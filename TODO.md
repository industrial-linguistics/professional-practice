# To-do 

### General

- [x] Clean up the tables and dot points in the README so that they are in proper markdown format. They are in a mixture of lines, unicode dotpoints, tab separated texts and so on

- [x] Create a separate to-do list file with everything that was in the README.md file (and remove it from README.md)

- [x] Create an `envsetup.sh` file with the necessary software that we will use for the pipeline
- [x] Update `index.html` whenever the pipeline produces new artifacts

**NOTE:** Each part should highlight relevant job roles, typical seniority levels, entry pathways, suitable personality traits, proportions of such roles in organisations and likely career progressions.

### Content to be created

Each part of the course requires its own learning objectives, slides,
narratives and quiz questions. The overall workflow for a part is:

1. Outline topics and objectives.
2. Create to-do list items for each topic to draft slides and write narratives.
3. Prepare quiz questions.

Use the checklist below to track progress for each part.

### Legislation

There are a few things that IT people need to know about Australian legislation.
	
- Aus. Privacy Act 1988 (especially APP 11 on security)
- Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 – SLAs can hinge on it for some clients
- EU GDPR
- China's PIPL
These need to go into week 5 when talking about contract SLAs I guess. Unless they need a separate week?

### Rendering pipeline

Each part is rendered separately. We should have intelligent GitHub workflows so that we can automate the whole process, but only do the minimal amount of audio re-rendering (and consequential other re-rendering) when things change.

- [ ] **Set up automation workflow**
  - Configure GitHub Actions to trigger the build process.
  - Ensure minimal re-rendering by checking for changes in source content before rebuilding assets.
- [ ] **Narration to audio**
  - For each slide, send the text to ElevenLabs (include preceding/following sentences for context).
  - Save the generated audio file using a checksum of `(normalized text, context, voice ID)`.
- [ ] **Audio caching**
  - Use the checksum as an S3 path and skip rendering when the file already exists.
- [ ] **Slide rendering**
  - Convert slide decks to PNG images using Marp.
- [ ] **Timing file generation**
  - Determine audio length for each slide.
  - Produce `slides.txt` entries (e.g., `file 'slide-01.png'`, `duration 5`).
- [ ] **Silent video creation**
  - Combine PNG slides into a silent video following `slides.txt`.
- [ ] **Audio concatenation**
  - Merge all slide audio segments into one track.
- [ ] **Video/audio merge**
  - Combine the silent video and the concatenated audio into the final video.
- [ ] **Upload step**
  - Upload the final video to S3 and the chosen hosting platform.
- [ ] **Question format conversion**
  - Transform quiz questions into the required format for the learning platform.
- [ ] **E-learning package generation**
  - Package the videos and questions into SCORM or another e-learning format.
- [ ] **Automated test suite**
  - Build tests that transcribe the rendered audio and verify it matches the text source.
- [ ] **E-book generation**
  - Compile all parts into a single e-book (PDF and EPUB).
