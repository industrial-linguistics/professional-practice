# Diagram and Illustration Ideas

## Incident vs Request Fulfilment (Part 1)
- Create a flowchart that branches on "service degraded?" and "pre-approved workflow?" leading to either the Incident path or Request path. Use colour-coding for urgency to reflect the MTTR focus on incidents versus satisfaction focus on requests.

## Service Value Chain (Part 1)
- [x] Add a wheel or cyclical diagram mapping "Plan → Improve → Engage → Design & Transition → Obtain/Build → Deliver & Support" with arrows to show continual improvement and feedback loops across activities. *Completed: Added to content/part-01/value-chain/slides.md*

## DORA Metrics Overview (Part 3)
- Include a quadrant or radar chart that plots Deployment Frequency, Lead Time, Change Failure Rate and MTTR to visually contrast current vs target performance.

## Vendor Engagement Funnel & MSP Hand-overs (Part 5)
- Insert a funnel graphic showing the five stages (Awareness & Outreach → Qualification & Discovery → Proposal Review & Due Diligence → Contracting & Onboarding → Operate & Improve) with swim-lanes for IT, finance, legal, and MSP to clarify ownership at each step.

## Post-Mortem Agenda (Part 4)
- Provide a timeline illustration of a typical post-incident review, highlighting when each role (responder, service owner, facilitator, scribe, business stakeholder) contributes and where documentation is captured.
