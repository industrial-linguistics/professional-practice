# Part 6 – Start-ups & Small-Biz IT

This part highlights how lean start-ups and small businesses bootstrap their IT stack, adopt lightweight tools, and scale processes as they grow.

**Why This Matters**

Tiny teams need enterprise-grade outcomes without enterprise budgets. Understanding the scrappy toolchains, compliance shortcuts and scaling pain points of founder-led companies prepares graduates to advise or join them with realistic expectations.

## Objectives

- Map the typical "day-zero" IT footprint for a start-up, from domains and identity to collaboration suites.
- Compare the cost and control trade-offs between DIY administration, managed service providers and fractional CTOs.
- Prioritise cybersecurity, compliance and business continuity controls appropriate to each growth stage.
- Recommend scalable processes for support, change and vendor management as headcount expands.
- Translate investor expectations (runway, burn, resilience) into pragmatic IT roadmaps.

## Key Topics

- Incorporating the company and standing up core services: domain registration, productivity suites, device procurement.
- Choosing lightweight SaaS for collaboration, ticketing, CRM and finance, plus when to graduate to enterprise platforms.
- Shadow IT and no-code/low-code experimentation: empowering teams without creating chaos.
- Security baselines on a shoestring: MDM-lite, password managers, zero-trust defaults and outsourced SOC options.
- Budgeting and FinOps for start-ups: usage monitoring, cloud credits, and forecasting burn tied to tooling.
- Working with fractional CTOs, virtual CIOs and MSPs to cover skill gaps.
- Preparing for investor due diligence: policies, documentation and metrics that demonstrate operational maturity.
- Scaling support processes from "ask the founder" to structured help desks and knowledge bases.
- Business continuity planning for small teams: backups, incident communication templates and vendor redundancy.
- Regional compliance considerations (privacy, payments, data residency) when selling globally from day one.
- Building lightweight vendor management rhythms for outsourced development, marketing and support partners.

## Job Roles Focus

- **IT Generalist / Founding Engineer**
  - *Typical seniority:* Mid-level technologists or career-switching engineers comfortable wearing many hats until Series A.
  - *Entry pathways:* Often ex-help desk or DevOps practitioners, bootcamp graduates or technical co-founders formalising IT.
  - *Personality traits:* Curious problem solvers who enjoy ambiguity, rapid learning and hands-on experimentation.
  - *Org proportion:* Usually 1 FTE covering 30–80 staff, supplemented by contractors for specialised needs.
  - *Career progression:* Grows into head of IT, platform engineering or security leadership as the company scales.

- **Fractional CTO / Virtual CIO**
  - *Typical seniority:* Seasoned director+ leaders lending strategic oversight a few days per month.
  - *Entry pathways:* Alumni of enterprise architecture, consultancy or repeat founders shifting into advisory work.
  - *Personality traits:* Strategic communicators who can coach executives, prioritise investments and manage vendors.
  - *Org proportion:* Engaged by ~25% of venture-backed start-ups pre-Series B, usually alongside 0–1 internal IT hires.
  - *Career progression:* Transition into board seats, interim CTO roles or boutique advisory practices.

- **MSP Account Manager & Field Technician**
  - *Typical seniority:* Mix of entry-level technicians for on-site work and senior service delivery managers coordinating SLAs.
  - *Entry pathways:* TAFE/apprenticeship programs, CompTIA pathways or internal promotions from service desk teams.
  - *Personality traits:* Service-minded troubleshooters who thrive on variety and customer relationship management.
  - *Org proportion:* MSP partners often contribute the equivalent of 0.5–2 FTE across 60–150 endpoints.
  - *Career progression:* Pathways into cybersecurity analyst, cloud engineer or customer success leader roles within the MSP.

- **Operations or Revenue Platform Owner**
  - *Typical seniority:* Business analysts or ops managers stepping into SaaS administration duties.
  - *Entry pathways:* Power users of CRM/finance tools, RevOps professionals, or former project coordinators.
  - *Personality traits:* Detail-oriented collaborators who translate business requirements into system configurations.
  - *Org proportion:* Typically 1 role per 40–60 go-to-market staff, often dual-hatted with finance or marketing ops.
  - *Career progression:* Moves into RevOps leadership, product operations or platform product management.

Expect start-ups to allocate only a handful of headcount to IT until Series B, so professionals must influence cross-functional peers and justify tooling investments with data.
