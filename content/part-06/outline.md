# Part 6 – Start-ups & Small-Biz IT

This part highlights how lean start-ups and small businesses bootstrap their IT stack, adopt lightweight tools, and scale processes as they grow.

> **Opening hook:** "Sarah just closed her seed round and has six weeks to hire 15 people. Her entire IT estate is Gmail, Slack, and a hope. What could possibly go wrong?"

Use Sarah's story as the running narrative, revisiting her decisions and panic moments as the session progresses.

**Why This Matters**

Tiny teams need enterprise-grade outcomes without enterprise budgets. Understanding the scrappy toolchains, compliance shortcuts and scaling pain points of founder-led companies prepares graduates to advise or join them with realistic expectations.

## Objectives

- Map the typical "day-zero" IT footprint for a start-up, from domains and identity to collaboration suites.
- Compare the cost and control trade-offs between DIY administration, managed service providers and fractional CTOs.
- Prioritise cybersecurity, compliance and business continuity controls appropriate to each growth stage.
- Recommend scalable processes for support, change and vendor management as headcount expands.
- Translate investor expectations (runway, burn, resilience) into pragmatic IT roadmaps.

## Session Flow & Key Topics

### Day 0–90: Ship Something Without Lighting Money on Fire

- Incorporating the company and standing up core services: domain registration, productivity suites, device procurement, and "CEO learns DNS the hard way" cautionary tale.
- Cloud vs. on-premise decisions: free tiers across AWS, Azure, GCP, when to stay serverless versus spinning up containers, and how startup credits influence the call.
- Shadow IT and no-code/low-code experimentation: empowering teams without creating chaos, with humour about "the intern who accidentally made everyone a Slack admin".
- Security baselines on a shoestring: MDM-lite, password managers, zero-trust defaults and outsourced SOC options—"have you tried turning it off and on again" evolves into lightweight monitoring dashboards.
- Remote-first reality check: device shipping, remote onboarding/offboarding, and managing a globally distributed, contractor-heavy workforce from day one.
- Pre-seed tool stack example ($200/month): Google Workspace, Slack, Notion, 1Password, Airtable plus context on when Sarah should resist enterprise upsell.
- Interactive checklist: "Day-zero startup IT assessment" covering identity, endpoints, backups and security toggles.

### Series A: Organise the Chaos Before Investors Ask Awkward Questions

- Choosing lightweight SaaS for collaboration, ticketing, CRM and finance, plus when to graduate to enterprise platforms; include "The great Zoom-to-Teams migration of 2023" mini-case.
- Budgeting and FinOps for start-ups: usage monitoring, cloud credits, forecasting burn tied to tooling, and an exercise calculating total monthly stack spend.
- Legal & compliance reality check: lawyers meeting DevOps on SOC 2, ISO 27001 timelines, open source licence compliance (GPL, Apache, MIT) and "Data privacy by design when you're moving fast".
- Working with fractional CTOs, virtual CIOs and MSPs to cover skill gaps, highlighting vendor relationship humour ("promised the moon, delivered a paper airplane").
- Remote-first talent logistics at scale: standardising equipment, automating access reviews, and preparing for global payroll/benefits integrations.
- Series A tool stack example (~$2K/month): Add Okta, Zoom, Jira, AWS credits, compliance tooling (Drata, Vanta) and compare serverless vs. container costs.
- Practical exercise: mock vendor evaluation using real SaaS pricing pages and "explain to the CEO why backups cost money" role-play.

### Series B+: Become the Enterprise Without Losing the Soul

- Preparing for investor due diligence: sample security questionnaires, "red flags that kill deals" stories, and mapping policies to board expectations.
- Scaling support processes from "ask the founder" to structured help desks, knowledge bases and ITSM (introduce ServiceNow vs. Jira Service Management trade-offs).
- Business continuity planning for small teams: backups, incident communication templates and vendor redundancy—"the night our MongoDB crashed" war story.
- Regional compliance considerations (privacy, payments, data residency) when selling globally, plus data governance humour (from "personal Dropbox" to enterprise retention policies).
- Building lightweight vendor management rhythms for outsourced development, marketing and support partners, including the Stripe vs. build-your-own payments decision.
- Series B enterprise migration stack (~$20K/month): Salesforce, ServiceNow, enterprise identity, SIEM, contract lifecycle management, with cost calculator worksheet.
- Guest speaker ideas: fractional CTO, startup-focused MSP account manager, VC diligence lead to discuss real expectations.

### Capstone: "Red Team Your Friend's Startup"

- Group exercise to critique a sample startup's tooling, run a security incident drill for a 15-person team, and map Sarah's company to the three-stage maturity model.
- Encourage participants to bring their own due diligence questions and create a take-home remediation roadmap.

## Job Roles Focus

- **IT Generalist / Founding Engineer**
  - *Typical seniority:* Mid-level technologists or career-switching engineers comfortable wearing many hats until Series A.
  - *Entry pathways:* Often ex-help desk or DevOps practitioners, bootcamp graduates or technical co-founders formalising IT.
  - *Personality traits:* Curious problem solvers who enjoy ambiguity, rapid learning and hands-on experimentation.
  - *Org proportion:* Usually 1 FTE covering 30–80 staff, supplemented by contractors for specialised needs.
  - *Career progression:* Grows into head of IT, platform engineering or security leadership as the company scales.

- **Fractional CTO / Virtual CIO**
  - *Typical seniority:* Seasoned director+ leaders lending strategic oversight a few days per month.
  - *Entry pathways:* Alumni of enterprise architecture, consultancy or repeat founders shifting into advisory work.
  - *Personality traits:* Strategic communicators who can coach executives, prioritise investments and manage vendors.
  - *Org proportion:* Engaged by ~25% of venture-backed start-ups pre-Series B, usually alongside 0–1 internal IT hires.

- **MSP Account Manager & Field Technician**
  - *Typical seniority:* Mix of entry-level technicians for on-site work and senior service delivery managers coordinating SLAs.

Expect start-ups to allocate only a handful of headcount to IT until Series B, so professionals must influence cross-functional peers and justify tooling investments with data.

- Cost calculator worksheet modelling pre-seed, Series A and Series B tooling spend scenarios.
- Sample investor security questionnaire with annotated "good" and "red flag" responses.
- Template for remote onboarding/offboarding logistics, including shipping providers and asset-tracking tips.
- Reading list: vendor case studies (Stripe, Zoom, ServiceNow), compliance playbooks, and blogs from startup-focused MSPs.

## Conversation & Humour Beats

- Thread Sarah's narrative through each stage: "Once you've sorted the domain and email, the next founder panic is…"
- Light-touch jokes: the four stages of startup IT (Panic, Google, Slack someone, hire a consultant) and vendor pricing shocks.
- Use real missteps (intern Slack admin mishap, MongoDB outage) to humanise lessons while reinforcing best practices.
