# Part 6 – Start-ups & Small-Biz IT

This part highlights how lean start-ups and small businesses bootstrap their IT stack, adopt lightweight tools, and scale processes as they grow.

**Why This Matters**

Tiny teams need enterprise-grade outcomes without enterprise budgets. Understanding the scrappy toolchains, compliance shortcuts and scaling pain points of founder-led companies prepares graduates to advise or join them with realistic expectations.

## Objectives

- Map the typical "day-zero" IT footprint for a start-up, from domains and identity to collaboration suites.
- Compare the cost and control trade-offs between DIY administration, managed service providers and fractional CTOs.
- Prioritise cybersecurity, compliance and business continuity controls appropriate to each growth stage.
- Recommend scalable processes for support, change and vendor management as headcount expands.

## Key Topics

- Incorporating the company and standing up core services: domain registration, productivity suites, device procurement.
- Choosing lightweight SaaS for collaboration, ticketing, CRM and finance, plus when to graduate to enterprise platforms.
- Shadow IT and no-code/low-code experimentation: empowering teams without creating chaos.
- Security baselines on a shoestring: MDM-lite, password managers, zero-trust defaults and outsourced SOC options.
- Budgeting and FinOps for start-ups: usage monitoring, cloud credits, and forecasting burn tied to tooling.
- Working with fractional CTOs, virtual CIOs and MSPs to cover skill gaps.
- Preparing for investor due diligence: policies, documentation and metrics that demonstrate operational maturity.
- Scaling support processes from "ask the founder" to structured help desks and knowledge bases.
- Business continuity planning for small teams: backups, incident communication templates and vendor redundancy.
- Regional compliance considerations (privacy, payments, data residency) when selling globally from day one.

## Job Roles Focus

- **IT Generalist / Founding Engineer** – often combines help desk, sysadmin and security duties in pre-Series A firms. Typically mid-level technologists comfortable wearing many hats; great for adaptable, curious personalities who enjoy ambiguity. Progression into engineering leadership or specialised architecture roles as the company scales.
- **Fractional CTO / Virtual CIO** – senior advisors parachuting in a few days per month to guide technical strategy and governance. Requires seasoned leadership background and consultative communication skills; suits strategic thinkers who like varied portfolios. Often transition into board roles or full-time CTO positions once product-market fit is reached.
- **MSP Account Manager & Field Technician** – external partners delivering managed endpoints, networking and support. Roles span entry-level technicians through senior service delivery managers. Ideal for service-minded problem solvers; provides pathways into cybersecurity, cloud engineering or customer success.
- **Operations or Revenue Platform Owner** – non-traditional IT roles embedded in marketing, sales or finance teams to administer SaaS stacks. Usually start as power users or business analysts; great for detail-oriented collaborators. Career trajectory can lead to RevOps leadership or product operations management.

Expect start-ups to allocate only a handful of headcount to IT until Series B, so professionals must influence cross-functional peers and justify tooling investments with data.
