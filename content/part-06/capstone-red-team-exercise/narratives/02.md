Speaker 1: Our scenario centers on Sarah's marketplace startupâ€”fifteen people juggling weekly releases, contractors and a global customer base.
Speaker 2: Their stack is modern but stitched together: managed Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Google Workspace, Notion, HubSpot, Stripe.
Speaker 1: They lean on a fractional SOC, an MSP for laptops and an offshore labeling partner, so third-party trust boundaries really matter.
Speaker 2: Pain points are already on the table: ad-hoc onboarding, shadow SaaS creep, almost no incident rehearsal and compliance debt chasing them into every sales call.
