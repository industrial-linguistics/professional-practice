Speaker 1: The maturity model keeps scoring consistent. Level one is ad hoc—heroics, no playbooks, barely any logging.
Speaker 2: Level two is emerging: some runbooks, partial MFA, retros that happen but rarely translate into change.
Speaker 1: Level three is scaling—quarterly tabletops, defined SLAs, vendor scorecards, baseline observability.
Speaker 2: Level four is measured with automated controls, resilience OKRs and real budgets; level five is optimized, where purple teaming and partner collaboration are business as usual.
