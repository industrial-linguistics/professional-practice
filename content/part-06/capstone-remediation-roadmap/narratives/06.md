Speaker 1: Let’s layer in time horizons—what lands in the first 30 days versus 60 or 90 so the plan feels achievable.
Speaker 2: In Sarah’s case the “30” bucket is the production database fix and MFA clean-up, while the “60” bucket covers runbook refreshes and due diligence trackers.
Speaker 1: Exactly, and anything needing contracts or new tools probably lives in the 90-day lane so leaders see budget bumps coming.
