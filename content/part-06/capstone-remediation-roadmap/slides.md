# Capstone: Remediation Roadmap
*Take-home planning and reflection prompts*

---

## Why a remediation roadmap?
- Translate red-team findings into funded, sequenced improvements.
- Give Sarah's startup evidence-ready talking points for boards and investors.
- Reinforce shared ownership across engineering, ops, security and go-to-market roles.
- Create space for reflection so the exercise fuels ongoing learning.

---

## Inputs to capture before planning
- Top risks surfaced during the capstone drill (people, process, technology, vendors).
- Severity, likelihood and customer impact notes from each scenario walkthrough.
- Maturity scores and quick-win recommendations already agreed by the pod.
- Open questions that need clarification from MSPs, SOC, legal or finance partners.

---

## Structuring the backlog
- Group actions into three swimlanes: **Stabilise** (stop the bleeding), **Reinforce** (lock in gains), **Scale** (longer-term bets).
- Map each action to the affected value stream: product delivery, customer support, compliance, revenue ops.
- Capture owner role, cross-functional collaborators and required budget signals.
- Record success metrics such as MTTR reduction, onboarding SLA adherence or vendor scorecard cadence.

---

## Prioritisation & due diligence prompts
- Score each item against business impact, regulatory exposure and team capacity.
- Ask "What would an investor or critical customer probe about this gap?" to sharpen requirements.
- Draft tailored diligence questions (e.g., "How do you verify MSP patch compliance?", "Where are customer PII backups stored?").
- Flag dependencies where answers require follow-up with finance, legal or platform teams.

---

## 30-60-90 action horizon
- **First 30 days:** ship high-impact quick wins (MFA rollout gaps, incident contact tree updates).
- **Days 31-60:** tackle process upgrades (runbook revisions, tabletop cadence, vendor cadence refresh).
- **Days 61-90:** launch strategic initiatives (observability uplift, SOC contract renegotiation, resilience OKRs).
- Note where funding, headcount or tooling procurement gates the start date.

---

## Ownership & accountability rituals
- Assign executive sponsor, delivery lead and supporting squad for each roadmap item.
- Add checkpoints to existing rituals: Monday ops stand-up, monthly security council, quarterly board pack.
- Incorporate customer-facing roles (success, support) to validate messaging and rollout plans.
- Track progress in the shared workspace with lightweight evidence uploads (screenshots, policy diffs, ticket links).

---

## Reflection prompts to close the capstone
- What surprised us about our resilience posture compared to expectations?
- Which assumptions about vendors, tooling or people proved wrong during the drill?
- How will we maintain psychological safety while pushing for accountability?
- What support or resources do we need from leadership to sustain the roadmap?

---

## Take-home assignment
- Each pod drafts a one-page remediation brief summarising context, top five actions and success measures.
- Prepare a 5-minute readout for the next session highlighting one risk retired and one risk still open.
- Schedule follow-up interviews with MSPs, SOC and legal counsel to validate due diligence answers.
- Bring lessons learned to the next investor update or client renewal conversation.

---

## Key takeaway
A remediation roadmap turns the capstone from a one-off event into a continuous improvement flywheel.
By sequencing actions, naming owners, capturing diligence questions and reflecting candidly, teams leave ready to advocate for investment and demonstrate progress with evidence.
