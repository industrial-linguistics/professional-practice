# Business Continuity for Small Teams
*Keeping work alive when you're running lean*

---

## Why continuity matters
- When your team tops out at a dozen people, losing one system for even a morning can wipe out a week of bookings and sour long-time customers.
- Single points of knowledge are common—if the only person who knows how to reboot the point-of-sale server is on vacation, recovery slows to a crawl.
- Continuity plans catalogue the make-or-break workflows, outline how to keep payroll, customer support and compliance obligations alive, and help you sleep knowing there is a map for bad days.
- Treat the work like operational insurance: a few focused hours now prevents the reputational fire drills, rebates and overtime that tend to follow improvised heroics.

## Sarah's market day outage
- Sarah co-owns a neighborhood meal-prep shop that relies on Square for payments, Google Drive for recipes and a single Wi-Fi router in the storefront office.
- The night before a big farmer's market, their internet provider had a regional outage; Square terminals could not phone home and the shared recipe spreadsheet stalled.
- Because nobody had printed backup recipe cards or enabled offline card mode, the team spent dawn calling regulars, rewriting shopping lists and scrambling for a mobile hotspot.
- The cleanup weekend included apologizing to customers, paying rush delivery fees and writing refunds that erased the event's profit.
- Lesson: continuity planning is not a luxury reserved for cloud-native startups—it keeps real-world cash flow predictable for scrappy teams, too.

## Core continuity building blocks
- **Impact analysis:** List your critical services, who depends on them, and how long you can tolerate downtime before customer trust or compliance breaks.
- **Recovery objectives:** Assign realistic recovery time (RTO) and recovery point (RPO) goals so the team knows when to switch to backups or manual processes.
- **Runbooks and checklists:** Write step-by-step playbooks for restoring data, rerouting support, updating leadership and coordinating with vendors.
- **Testing cadence:** Schedule quarterly tabletop discussions and twice-yearly restore drills so people practice in calm conditions instead of fumbling live.
- **Feedback loop:** After every incident or rehearsal, capture lessons, update documents and retire steps that no longer match how the business actually works.

## Backup and data recovery essentials
- Automate daily snapshots for systems that change slowly, layer in point-in-time recovery for transactional databases, and confirm cloud providers meet your RPO targets.
- Keep at least one copy isolated from your primary environment—whether that is a different cloud region, encrypted external drive or managed backup service.
- Test restores in a staging or lab environment each quarter, verifying not only that files exist but that they boot, import and connect correctly.
- Document retention periods, legal hold requirements and sensitive folders so you do not accidentally purge regulatory evidence or customer contracts.
- Assign two owners per backup workflow, ensuring vacations or turnover do not leave the team unsure how to trigger a restore under pressure.

## Incident communication templates
- Draft ready-to-send outlines for a status page post, customer email, social update and internal leadership brief while you are calm.
- In each template, note who triggers the update, who approves the wording, and how frequently you promise to send follow-ups until the issue is resolved.
- Pair plain-language descriptions for customers with concise technical timelines for partners or regulators, so every audience hears the detail they expect.
- Maintain a direct message, SMS or phone tree for stakeholders who should not learn about outages from social media, including key clients and executives.
- After an incident, archive the final copy alongside a timeline summary—those artifacts become training material and evidence for postmortems.

## Vendor and tooling redundancy
- List every external tool the business depends on, from payment processors to scheduling apps, and rate the operational impact if each one fails for a day.
- Capture built-in redundancy options such as offline modes, mobile hotspots, secondary domains or quick-to-enable free tiers that could bridge short disruptions.
- Discuss emergency credits, burst capacity or expedited support with vendors now, documenting contract clauses and account numbers in an accessible location.
- Store offline copies of critical contact trees, API keys, setup instructions and invoice histories so you can move vendors or reconnect services without internet access.
- Define manual or low-tech workarounds—paper intake forms, cash drawers, temporary spreadsheets—so customer-facing teams can keep moving while systems recover.

## Lightweight continuity checklist
1. Inventory the critical services, data stores, processes and owners that keep revenue flowing each week.
2. Capture RTO and RPO targets next to each item, attaching evidence that backups or alternative workflows actually meet those goals.
3. Update contact trees, vendor directories and communication templates at least quarterly so names, phone numbers and sample language stay fresh.
4. Schedule restore tests, tabletop drills and documentation reviews on the shared team calendar, assigning facilitators in advance.
5. Log lessons learned after every exercise or real incident, then refresh the plan and redistribute it so people build confidence through repetition.

## Roles, traits and progression
- Typical continuity leads inside small organizations include fractional CTOs, operations generalists, and compliance-focused managers who straddle technology and process.
- Entry points often look like support engineers who volunteer to own incident response, founders doubling as IT admins, or managed service providers on a part-time retainer.
- The standout traits are calm decision-making under pressure, documentation-first instincts, and empathy for teammates juggling customers while systems misbehave.
- Career progression can move from ops generalist to continuity lead, then to head of resilience or enterprise risk as the company grows in headcount and complexity.
- Encourage cross-training: finance, HR and customer success leaders who understand the continuity plan become ambassadors who keep priorities balanced during disruptions.

## Key takeaway
Preparedness beats heroics. Investing in documented backups, rehearsed communication plans and clear owner handoffs gives even the leanest team a calm, repeatable response when things break at 2am.
Continuity work also protects the people doing the work—teammates avoid burnout, leaders stay ahead of regulatory questions, and customers feel cared for instead of left in the dark.
Treat this deck as your invitation to schedule one small improvement this week, whether it is printing backup recipes, updating the contact tree, or booking the next tabletop drill.
Those incremental steps build a culture where setbacks become stories of resilience rather than regret.
