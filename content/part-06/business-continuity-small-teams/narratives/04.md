Speaker 1: [pragmatically] Backups are only useful if they actually restore. Start by automating daily snapshots for slow-changing files and point-in-time recovery for transactional data.
Speaker 2: Then keep at least one copy away from your primary environmentâ€”another cloud region, an encrypted drive at the office, or a trusted backup service.
Speaker 1: Every quarter, boot those backups in a staging space to confirm they open, sync, and connect the way you expect.
Speaker 2: Document retention rules and assign two people to each workflow so vacations, turnover, or illness never leave you guessing when a restore clock is ticking.
