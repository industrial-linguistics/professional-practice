# Core continuity building blocks

Walk through the foundational pieces before diving into tools. Start with impact analysis: list your key services and what happens if they go offline for an hour, a day or a week. Next, define recovery objectives—recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO)—so the team knows how much downtime and data loss the business can tolerate. Pair those targets with runbooks that anyone can follow, then schedule recurring exercises. Tabletop simulations and restore drills turn theory into muscle memory and expose brittle assumptions.
