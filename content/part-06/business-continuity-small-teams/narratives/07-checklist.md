# Lightweight continuity checklist

Guide learners through turning the concepts into a living document. The checklist starts with an inventory of critical services and data, linked to owners. Next, capture the recovery targets and proofâ€”screenshots or logs showing a recent successful restore. Keep contact lists and communication templates updated quarterly; calendar reminders help. Finally, emphasise reflection: after every incident or drill, log what worked, what failed and update the plan. This feedback loop prevents the binder-on-the-shelf syndrome that plagues many continuity efforts.
