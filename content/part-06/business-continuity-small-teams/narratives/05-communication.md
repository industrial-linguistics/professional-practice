# Incident communication templates

Communication is half the battle during downtime. Encourage learners to pre-draft updates for the status page, customer emails and investor briefings. Each template should cover what happened, customer impact, what is being done and when the next update will arrive. Clarify roles: who has authority to publish, who reviews language for legal or regulatory compliance, and who notifies internal stakeholders. Stress multi-channel readinessâ€”email, SMS, phone trees and even recorded hotline messages. The goal is to avoid writing prose while adrenaline is spiking.
