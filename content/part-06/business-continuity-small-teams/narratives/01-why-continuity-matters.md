# Why continuity matters

Small teams often run on heroic effort and implicit knowledge. That works until the first 2am outage, when the only person who knows the database password is on a long-haul flight. Continuity planning simply writes down how to keep serving customers when something fails. You map what is mission-critical, who relies on it and how quickly you need it back. That clarity protects revenue, contractual obligations and your teamâ€™s sanity. Treat continuity as an investment in stability, not a bureaucratic distraction. A lightweight plan beats improvising under pressure every single time.
