# Key takeaway

End by reinforcing that preparation beats heroics. When people have calm time to build the plan, they can harden backups, script restores and pre-write updates.

Encourage learners to block two hours this week to start their own continuity checklist so the next outage becomes a managed incident, not a career-defining scramble.
