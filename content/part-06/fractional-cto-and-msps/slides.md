# Working with Fractional CTOs and MSPs
*Choosing the right leadership model for lean teams*

---

## Why fractional leadership exists
- Start-ups need senior judgment before they can afford full-time executives
- Fractional CTOs, virtual CIOs and MSPs fill different gaps across strategy, delivery and run operations
- Typical engagements run 6–18 months until hiring a permanent leader or internal capability matures
- Expect blended fees: day-rates for discovery, retainers for leadership time, per-incident or per-device MSP charges
- Stage cues: pre-seed firms borrow architecture patterns, Series A scale to multi-region uptime, Series B demand compliance rigour and portfolio planning
- Equity trade-offs: 0.5–1% advisor equity versus a $150k cash salary keeps burn low when revenue is volatile

---

### Example: Series A SaaS Startup
- **Situation**: 15-person team, scaling from 1K to 10K users in six months
- **Challenge**: CTO departed mid-migration, roadmap slipped, board mandated security audit
- **Solution**: 6-month fractional CTO to stabilise architecture and hiring paired with co-managed MSP for compliance automation
- **Outcome**: Permanent CTO hired, SOC 2 audit passed on schedule, roadmap velocity recovered without losing key customers

## When to engage each partner type
| Situation | Fractional CTO | Virtual CIO | Managed Service Provider |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Product roadmap in flux | ✅ Sets architecture guardrails, mentors engineering leads | ⚠️ Provides governance but less hands-on | ❌ Focuses on run operations |
| Board demanding IT controls | ⚠️ Can cover interim CIO duties | ✅ Owns policy, risk and budgeting cadence | ✅ Implements controls and monitoring |
| 24/7 support gaps | ⚠️ Designs on-call model | ⚠️ Escalation owner | ✅ Runs help desk, NOC and incident response |
| Major platform migration | ✅ Leads technical decision-making | ✅ Aligns roadmap with business priorities | ✅ Supplies delivery squads and change management |

---

### Typical Investment Levels
- **Fractional CTO**: $8K–15K/month for 1–2 days per week, often with ramp-down clauses
- **Virtual CIO**: $5K–10K/month covering governance, budgeting and board prep
- **Co-managed MSP**: $3K–8K/month plus per-incident fees for after-hours or specialised work
- **Budget rule**: Allocate 15–25% of the engineering/IT budget to external leadership to avoid starving internal capability
- **Equity swaps**: Some leaders accept 0.25–0.5% options in lieu of cash—model dilution before agreeing

---

## Partnership models and ownership
- **Embedded fractional leader**: 1–2 days/week, attends exec meetings, drives architecture and hiring
- **Project-based strategist**: 4–6 week discovery, hands over roadmap to internal team or MSP
- **Co-managed MSP**: Provider runs service desk while founders retain product and security decisions; expect shared tooling within 30–60 days
- **Full outsource**: MSP controls infrastructure, releases and vendor management—risk of skill atrophy without oversight and longer re-entry timeline
- **Transition milestones**: Define 30-, 60- and 90-day checkpoints for documentation, tooling access and leadership cadence

---

## Evaluating fractional CTO candidates
- What stage experience do they have (seed, Series A, turnaround) and which outcomes did they deliver?
- How do they split time across clients and guarantee availability during incidents or board crunches?
- Ask for artifacts: recent architecture memos, hiring scorecards, budget models
- Probe for collaboration style with in-house engineers and product leads—coach, architect, or fixer?

---

## Evaluating MSP partners
- Incident response expectations: who answers the 2 a.m. call and within which SLA window?
- Security posture: SOC 2, ISO 27001, background checks, tooling stack for monitoring and patching
- Integration depth: can they plug into your ticketing, SSO and asset inventory instead of running siloed tools?
- Commercial transparency: rate cards for after-hours work, pass-through vendor costs, exit clause specifics

---

## The vendor promise vs delivery gap
- Sales teams promise "unlimited support"—clarify concurrency limits and scope exclusions
- Ask how many startups of your size they actively serve; beware being the smallest fish
- Request real-world incident reviews: what went wrong, how communication flowed, lessons learned
- Humour helps: "Show me the runbook, not just the glossy brochure" sets tone without burning bridges
- When they tout "AI monitoring everything", counter with "Great—show me the 3 a.m. alert stream and who triaged it"
- If they promise "seamless integration", ask "How many API calls will your tooling make against our stack each hour?"

---

## Due diligence and reference checks
- Speak with at least two former clients about responsiveness and knowledge transfer at exit
- Run a tabletop exercise during contracting to observe decision-making and tooling capabilities
- Review subcontractor usage and ensure confidentiality clauses cover fractional leaders and MSP engineers
- Align insurance requirements (cyber, professional indemnity) with your customer contracts
- Protect intellectual property: stipulate source control access boundaries, invention assignment, and how strategic docs are stored
- Watch for red flags: vague SLAs, resistance to documentation handover, or reliance on a single engineer for critical services

---

## Onboarding and ongoing governance
- Define RACI across roadmap ownership, change approvals, vendor spend and incident command
- Schedule joint quarterly business reviews with metrics dashboards and backlog updates
- Capture intellectual property in shared repositories with clear licensing in contracts and shared editing norms
- Integrate external leaders into stand-ups, retros and architecture councils so internal teams retain voice and context
- Plan the exit: 30–60 day transition timeline, documentation handover and credential rotation
- Track performance: operational SLAs met, roadmap throughput, hiring progress and internal capability uplift

---

## Red Flags and Exit Strategies
- **Warning signs**: Repeatedly delayed incident responses, scope creep without change control, thin documentation despite reminders
- **Exit planning**: Keep 30-day notice baked into contracts, require handover checklists, insist on joint credential rotation
- **Backup plans**: Maintain internal runbooks for critical systems, cross-train staff, avoid single points of failure in access or knowledge

---

## Industry, geography and scaling considerations
- **Healthcare & FinTech**: Ensure partners can evidence HIPAA, PCI-DSS or local privacy compliance and support security questionnaires
- **B2B SaaS**: Demand customer assurance support—MSP-ready answers for SOC 2, ISO 27001, and shared trust portals
- **Consumer apps**: Focus on scaling infrastructure, CDN tuning and observability for viral usage spikes
- **Geographic spread**: Align on time zones, language coverage and in-region data residency obligations
- **Scaling decisions**: Define metrics (lead time, defect escape rate, customer NPS) that trigger transition from fractional to full-time leadership

## Key takeaway
Fractional CTOs and MSPs can accelerate maturity when paired thoughtfully.
Use structured evaluation questions, humour to surface mismatched expectations and explicit governance to avoid abdication.
Assignment: Draft five evaluation questions tailored to your current stage and share them with a peer for critique.
