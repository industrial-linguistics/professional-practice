# Working with Fractional CTOs and MSPs
*Choosing the right leadership model for lean teams*

---

## Why fractional leadership exists
- Start-ups need senior judgment before they can afford full-time executives
- Fractional CTOs, virtual CIOs and MSPs fill different gaps across strategy, delivery and run operations
- Typical engagements run 6–18 months until hiring a permanent leader or internal capability matures
- Expect blended fees: day-rates for discovery, retainers for leadership time, per-incident or per-device MSP charges

---

## When to engage each partner type
| Situation | Fractional CTO | Virtual CIO | Managed Service Provider |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Product roadmap in flux | ✅ Sets architecture guardrails, mentors engineering leads | ⚠️ Provides governance but less hands-on | ❌ Focuses on run operations |
| Board demanding IT controls | ⚠️ Can cover interim CIO duties | ✅ Owns policy, risk and budgeting cadence | ✅ Implements controls and monitoring |
| 24/7 support gaps | ⚠️ Designs on-call model | ⚠️ Escalation owner | ✅ Runs help desk, NOC and incident response |
| Major platform migration | ✅ Leads technical decision-making | ✅ Aligns roadmap with business priorities | ✅ Supplies delivery squads and change management |

---

## Partnership models and ownership
- **Embedded fractional leader**: 1–2 days/week, attends exec meetings, drives architecture and hiring
- **Project-based strategist**: 4–6 week discovery, hands over roadmap to internal team or MSP
- **Co-managed MSP**: Provider runs service desk while founders retain product and security decisions
- **Full outsource**: MSP controls infrastructure, releases and vendor management—risk of skill atrophy without oversight

---

## Evaluating fractional CTO candidates
- What stage experience do they have (seed, Series A, turnaround) and which outcomes did they deliver?
- How do they split time across clients and guarantee availability during incidents or board crunches?
- Ask for artifacts: recent architecture memos, hiring scorecards, budget models
- Probe for collaboration style with in-house engineers and product leads—coach, architect, or fixer?

---

## Evaluating MSP partners
- Incident response expectations: who answers the 2 a.m. call and within which SLA window?
- Security posture: SOC 2, ISO 27001, background checks, tooling stack for monitoring and patching
- Integration depth: can they plug into your ticketing, SSO and asset inventory instead of running siloed tools?
- Commercial transparency: rate cards for after-hours work, pass-through vendor costs, exit clause specifics

---

## The vendor promise vs delivery gap
- Sales teams promise "unlimited support"—clarify concurrency limits and scope exclusions
- Ask how many startups of your size they actively serve; beware being the smallest fish
- Request real-world incident reviews: what went wrong, how communication flowed, lessons learned
- Humour helps: "Show me the runbook, not just the glossy brochure" sets tone without burning bridges

---

## Due diligence and reference checks
- Speak with at least two former clients about responsiveness and knowledge transfer at exit
- Run a tabletop exercise during contracting to observe decision-making and tooling capabilities
- Review subcontractor usage and ensure confidentiality clauses cover fractional leaders and MSP engineers
- Align insurance requirements (cyber, professional indemnity) with your customer contracts

---

## Onboarding and ongoing governance
- Define RACI across roadmap ownership, change approvals, vendor spend and incident command
- Schedule joint quarterly business reviews with metrics dashboards and backlog updates
- Capture intellectual property in shared repositories with clear licensing in contracts
- Plan the exit: 30–60 day transition timeline, documentation handover and credential rotation

## Key takeaway
Fractional CTOs and MSPs can accelerate maturity when paired thoughtfully.
Use structured evaluation questions, humour to surface mismatched expectations and explicit governance to avoid abdication.
Assignment: Draft five evaluation questions tailored to your current stage and share them with a peer for critique.
