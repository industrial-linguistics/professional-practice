title: Preparing for Investor Due Diligence

# Preparing for Investor Due Diligence
*Give investors confidence that controls match the story*

---

## Why diligence heats up post-Seed
- Series A/B investors expect proof that security, finance and compliance scale with revenue.
- Unanswered questions slow down term sheets and spook co-investors.
- Sarah's seed deck promised "enterprise-ready"—now she must show receipts, not artisanal buzzword salad.
- Preparing early buys founders time when the data room inevitably expands.

---

## Core workstreams to coordinate
- **Financial & operational** – cash runway, burn, vendor commitments, SOC 2 roadmap.
- **Security & infrastructure** – access controls, incident history, backup testing evidence.
- **Product & customers** – roadmap dependencies, SLAs, churn and expansion metrics.
- Assign an owner per stream (CFO, CTO, RevOps) with a single program manager stitching updates together.

---

## Building a living data room
- Centralise policies, architecture diagrams, vendor contracts and board minutes with version control.
- Include short context notes so outsiders understand why a document matters.
- Track open actions with due dates—investors value visibility more than perfection.
- Keep sensitive exports (e.g. customer lists) in controlled folders with watermarking and access logs.

---

## Security questionnaire watch-outs
- Identify common asks: MFA coverage, penetration test cadence, disaster recovery drills, privacy compliance.
- Expect specifics like "What percentage of privileged accounts enforce MFA?"—"82% today, moving to 100% by Q2 via YubiKeys" beats evasive answers.
- Flag red signals early—shared admin accounts, missing asset inventory, stale incident response plans.
- Draft honest mitigation plans instead of hand-waving; investors reward realism.
- Maintain a FAQ that translates technical control names into plain language for partners and board members.

---

## Map policies to governance expectations
- Tie each policy to the board committee or advisor who sponsors it (e.g. audit, risk, security).
- Summarise decision rights: who approves exceptions, how often reviews occur, what evidence is logged.
- Highlight how legal, finance and engineering collaborate on compliance checkpoints.
- Share a governance calendar: Q1 risk committee + SOC 2 readiness review, Q2 audit committee + PCI scan, Q3 full board + cyber tabletop, Q4 certification renewals.

---

## Evidence and metrics investors trust
- Share quarterly security posture reports, uptime SLAs achieved (99.5%+ is Series A table stakes, 99.9% a stretch goal), mean-time-to-recover trends.
- Bundle SOC 2 gap assessments, vulnerability remediation stats (e.g. 95% of critical vulns closed <14 days) and third-party attestations.
- Pair qualitative narratives with dashboards so numbers land with context.
- Show how risk registers flow into product and operations backlogs for execution.

---

## Rehearse the diligence conversation
- Run a mock Q&A with advisors posing as investors; record it for coaching.
- Equip every exec with a "two-sentence answer + escalation" script for their domain—"Our incident response playbook assigns roles within 15 minutes, then hands to the CISO-led war room; want to see the drill notes?".
- Prepare backup slides for deeper dives—architecture, vendor matrix, privacy controls.
- Log follow-ups immediately so nothing slips between meetings.

---

## Roles, traits and progression
- **Program manager / Chief of staff** – orchestrates data room updates, keeps stakeholders aligned. Typical comp: $140k–$190k + equity at Series A/B.
- **Security or compliance lead** – translates questionnaires into actionable backlog items. Expect $160k–$210k, often paired with bonus tied to audit milestones.
- **Finance & RevOps partners** – validate metrics and customer contract obligations; senior managers sit $130k–$170k with upside at close.
- Thrives on diplomacy, attention to detail and appetite for structured storytelling.
- Career paths lead to VP Operations, Head of Trust & Safety or venture portfolio advisor roles.
- Map progression milestones (owning first diligence cycle, leading certification renewals, joining board meetings) so the team sees a runway.

---

## Legal and regulatory readiness
- Catalogue applicable regulations early: GDPR/UK GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, HIPAA or SOC 2 depending on vertical.
- Document lawful bases for processing, data retention standards and DPA coverage for every critical vendor.
- Show international scaling awareness—data residency in the EU, onshore support SLAs for APAC, breach notification variations.
- Partner legal and security leads on a quarterly compliance checkpoint so surprises surface before term sheet negotiations.

---

## Timeline and critical path
- Typical diligence cycles span 6–10 weeks from data room access to close; plan backward from your cash runway.
- Week 1–2: data room review and follow-up questions; Week 3–5: deep dives with functional leaders; Week 6–8: confirmatory audits and customer calls.
- Highlight dependencies—SOC 2 Type II report delivery, customer reference availability, legal opinion drafting.
- Maintain a RAID log so risks, assumptions, issues and decisions stay visible to executives and investors.

---

## Case study: NimbusPay Series A
- Day 0: pre-seeded data room with 120 curated artifacts, ownership tracker in Notion.
- Day 14: investors flagged MFA gaps; remediation plan committed to 100% hardware keys in 45 days with $15k budget.
- Day 35: cross-border payroll expansion triggered GDPR transfer impact assessment and Canadian PIPEDA review.
- Day 52: diligence closed after mock board review confirmed policy-to-governance alignment and incident drill readiness.

---

## Red flags hall of fame (and fixes)
- "Security lead" is a contractor 5 hours/week → solution: interim virtual CISO backed by engineering manager accountable for controls.
- No incident response drill since founding → schedule tabletop within 30 days, document after-action and add to board pack.
- Customer data stored in shared S3 bucket with ex-employee access → run access audit, enable object lock, revoke stale keys same week.
- Legal can't articulate data residency commitments → map contractual obligations, document sub-processors, update privacy notice.

---

## Resources and templates
- Diligence tracker template: executive owner matrix + follow-up SLA checklist.
- Recommended tools: Tugboat Logic or Drata for control evidence, Notion/Confluence for playbooks, Vanta-style dashboards for KPIs.
- Reading list: NIST CSF profiles for startups, AICPA SOC 2 implementation guide, "Secure SaaS" podcast episodes 12–15.
- Share a partner directory (fractional CFOs, privacy counsel, IR advisors) to scale support as demands grow.

---

## Key takeaways
- Start gathering evidence six months before you fundraise; aim for annual-physical calm, not emergency-room chaos.
- Treat the data room as a living product with owners, release notes and guardrails.
- Red flags are inevitable—own them, show remediation progress and connect it to board oversight.
- Investor confidence grows when policies, metrics and narratives reinforce one another.
