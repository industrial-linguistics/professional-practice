title: Preparing for Investor Due Diligence

# Preparing for Investor Due Diligence
*Give investors confidence that controls match the story*

---

## Why diligence heats up post-Seed
- Series A/B investors expect proof that security, finance and compliance scale with revenue.
- Unanswered questions slow down term sheets and spook co-investors.
- Sarah's seed deck promised "enterprise-ready"—now she must show receipts.
- Preparing early buys founders time when the data room inevitably expands.

---

## Core workstreams to coordinate
- **Financial & operational** – cash runway, burn, vendor commitments, SOC 2 roadmap.
- **Security & infrastructure** – access controls, incident history, backup testing evidence.
- **Product & customers** – roadmap dependencies, SLAs, churn and expansion metrics.
- Assign an owner per stream (CFO, CTO, RevOps) with a single program manager stitching updates together.

---

## Building a living data room
- Centralise policies, architecture diagrams, vendor contracts and board minutes with version control.
- Include short context notes so outsiders understand why a document matters.
- Track open actions with due dates—investors value visibility more than perfection.
- Keep sensitive exports (e.g. customer lists) in controlled folders with watermarking and access logs.

---

## Security questionnaire watch-outs
- Identify common asks: MFA coverage, penetration test cadence, disaster recovery drills, privacy compliance.
- Flag red signals early—shared admin accounts, missing asset inventory, stale incident response plans.
- Draft honest mitigation plans instead of hand-waving; investors reward realism.
- Maintain a FAQ that translates technical control names into plain language for partners and board members.

---

## Map policies to governance expectations
- Tie each policy to the board committee or advisor who sponsors it (e.g. audit, risk, security).
- Summarise decision rights: who approves exceptions, how often reviews occur, what evidence is logged.
- Highlight how legal, finance and engineering collaborate on compliance checkpoints.
- Provide a calendar linking board meetings, audits and certification renewals.

---

## Evidence and metrics investors trust
- Share quarterly security posture reports, uptime SLAs achieved, mean-time-to-recover trends.
- Bundle SOC 2 gap assessments, vulnerability remediation stats and third-party attestations.
- Pair qualitative narratives with dashboards so numbers land with context.
- Show how risk registers flow into product and operations backlogs for execution.

---

## Rehearse the diligence conversation
- Run a mock Q&A with advisors posing as investors; record it for coaching.
- Equip every exec with a "two-sentence answer + escalation" script for their domain.
- Prepare backup slides for deeper dives—architecture, vendor matrix, privacy controls.
- Log follow-ups immediately so nothing slips between meetings.

---

## Roles, traits and progression
- **Program manager / Chief of staff** – orchestrates data room updates, keeps stakeholders aligned.
- **Security or compliance lead** – translates questionnaires into actionable backlog items.
- **Finance & RevOps partners** – validate metrics and customer contract obligations.
- Thrives on diplomacy, attention to detail and appetite for structured storytelling.
- Career paths lead to VP Operations, Head of Trust & Safety or venture portfolio advisor roles.

---

## Key takeaways
- Start gathering evidence six months before you fundraise; crisis-mode prep shows in every answer.
- Treat the data room as a living product with owners, release notes and guardrails.
- Red flags are inevitable—own them, show remediation progress and connect it to board oversight.
- Investor confidence grows when policies, metrics and narratives reinforce one another.
