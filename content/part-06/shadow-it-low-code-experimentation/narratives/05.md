# Slide 5 — Cautionary tale: the Slack admin summer

Speaker 1: True story: an intern built a workflow bot to celebrate customer renewals.
Speaker 2: Adorable—until they ticked "Workspace Admin" for every channel lead because "permissions are annoying".
Speaker 1: Within days a curious contractor explored the new menu and archived the finance history channel.
Speaker 2: Cue frantic tickets to Slack support, legal drafting disclosure emails, and the CTO spending Sunday rebuilding export logs. Enthusiasm needs seatbelts.
Speaker 1: Also, three years of quarterly reports vanished—the CFO's expression was... memorable.
