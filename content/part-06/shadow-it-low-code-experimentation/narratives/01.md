# Slide 1 — Shadow IT and Low-Code Experimentation

Speaker 1: [energetic] Shadow IT is not a villain; it's a neon sign flashing "your teams are hungry to solve problems." 
Speaker 2: And banning every unsanctioned app just drives the experiments deeper underground, with zero telemetry.
Speaker 1: Our job tonight is to channel that curiosity into a safe runway—guardrails, not handcuffs.
Speaker 2: Because when you give people space to prototype responsibly, innovation and compliance can actually coexist.
