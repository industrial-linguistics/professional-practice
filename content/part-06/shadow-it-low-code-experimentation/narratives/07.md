# Slide 7 — Safe sandboxes for experimentation

Speaker 1: Guardrails don’t mean boring. Give teams playgrounds with sanitized data and disposable connectors.
Speaker 2: Picture this: finance gets a dedicated Tableau workspace, anonymized revenue data, connectors to approved databases, and templates that auto-expire after 90 days.
Speaker 1: Golden templates save hours—they come preloaded with logging, naming conventions and "who to call" notes.
Speaker 2: Also, route integrations through service accounts so when someone leaves, production tokens aren’t tied to their inbox.
Speaker 1: Bonus points for running quarterly hack nights with platform engineers coaching—experimentation becomes a team sport, not a secret hobby.
