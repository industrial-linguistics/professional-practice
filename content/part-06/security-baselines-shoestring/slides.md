# Security Baselines on a Shoestring
*Keep founders secure without burning the runway*
- Security debt accrues interest; early baselines keep future compliance projects from exploding in cost.
- Compliance basics like GDPR Article 32 or SOC 2 CC6 expect controls even at ten-person scale; ignoring them stalls enterprise momentum.

## Security 101: Threats that sink startups
- Phishing is the con-artist email that steals passwords and invoices; ransomware locks files until you pay in crypto; insider mistakes leak customer data without malice.
- Attackers do not check your runway before blasting campaigns—see the 2023 Mailchimp breach that let intruders pivot into countless small SaaS companies.
- One lost laptop without encryption can trigger GDPR breach notices or torpedo a SOC 2 deal worth six figures of ARR.
- Baselines do not guarantee invincibility, but they stack the odds so that common incidents are expensive inconveniences instead of existential crises.
- Security debt accrues interest; early baselines keep future compliance projects from exploding in cost.
- Compliance basics like GDPR Article 32 or SOC 2 CC6 expect controls even at ten-person scale; ignoring them stalls enterprise momentum.

## Security jargon decoder for new IT pros
- **MFA (multi-factor authentication):** extra proofs like a YubiKey or authenticator app layered on top of passwords so stolen credentials alone fail.
- **SOC (security operations centre):** humans plus tooling watching telemetry to spot and respond to suspicious activity—think night-shift security guards with dashboards.
- **SIEM (security information and event management):** the log brain collecting alerts from identity, endpoint and cloud systems for the SOC to interpret.
- **MDM (mobile device management):** software that enforces encryption, patching and remote wipe on laptops and phones—even from a beach Wi-Fi connection.
- **Zero trust:** the philosophy that every access request must prove it is legitimate, no matter the network location or job title.

---

## Why baselines still matter when cash is tight
- Investors, enterprise customers and cyber insurers now bake security questionnaires into contracts; failing them can delay six-figure deals by months.
- Real incidents are brutal: Code42 reported $4M in recovery costs after a ransomware hit, and password reuse enabled the LastPass breach that rippled through startups for weeks.
- Regulations like GDPR and US state privacy laws mandate timely breach reporting and fines; strong baselines reduce both likelihood and penalties.
- Sleep matters: leaders who know patching, backups and access reviews are humming can focus on product, not worst-case tabletop fantasies at 2 a.m.
- Documented guardrails turn ad-hoc heroics into repeatable habits that contractors, MSPs and auditors can understand instantly.

---

## Essential controls triage (with real stakes)
- Start with MFA everywhere: hardware keys for admin roles and phishing-resistant app prompts for staff; a $70 YubiKey beats weeks of resetting compromised SaaS portals.
- Mandate a team password manager so shared credentials and API tokens live in audited vaults; cite the LastPass cascade as the cautionary tale for storing secrets in docs.
- Automate patching by enabling auto-update channels and alerting on drift—missing a browser patch enabled the 0-day that hit Uber’s contractor in 2022.
- Follow the 3-2-1 backup pattern with offline snapshots so ransomware can’t wipe both production and synced cloud drives in one shot.
- Expect to spend $15–$25 per person monthly for MFA, password management and backup tooling combined—less than catered coffee yet business-saving.

---

## Identity and access on a lean budget
- Use Google Workspace or Entra ID as the identity backbone, enforcing zero-trust defaults like blocking legacy IMAP and requiring device compliance for sensitive apps.
- Configure conditional access like a bouncer who actually checks IDs, evaluating location, device health and role before opening the velvet rope.
- Automate joiner/mover/leaver steps with HRIS webhooks or low-code scripts so account creation and revocation happen within minutes, not when someone remembers.
- Demonstrate cost-benefit: a $6/month automation beats the $30k bill from a disgruntled ex-contractor who retained production access.
- Run quarterly least-privilege reviews with founders and functional leads so business context guides access trims instead of blunt, confusing removals.

---

## Device security without a full IT team
- Adopt lightweight MDM such as Kandji, JumpCloud or Intune Business Premium for <$10 per user; they handle encryption enforcement, firewall, screen-lock timers and lost-device wipes.
- Share the coffee-shop cautionary tale: a stolen laptop once forced a two-week scramble because no remote wipe existed—MDM turned the sequel into a two-hour non-event.
- Pre-register hardware keys and recovery contacts in the MDM so replacements ship ready to go, avoiding frantic setup calls during an incident.
- Segment update rings to push critical patches within 24 hours, with dashboards that flag stragglers before auditors or malware do.
- Document DIY checklists for founders covering "power wash and redeploy" steps so basic remediation doesn’t require heroics from the sole IT contractor.

---

## SaaS and network hygiene (with a wink)
- Centralise SaaS discovery using finance exports, browser extensions and SSO logs to expose the "don’t tell mom" shadow IT apps before compliance teams do.
- Force SSO or at least MFA on critical services; disable password-plus-email logins where possible so phishing kits meet dead ends.
- Deploy DNS filtering via NextDNS or Cloudflare Teams as the remote-friendly firewall that blocks malware domains without shipping firewalls to apartments.
- Catalogue vendor data locations, default retention and breach playbooks so customer questionnaires and GDPR Article 30 records are answered without panic.
- Sprinkle humour in onboarding: "Security hygiene—like dental hygiene but with fewer cavities and more credentials." It sticks better than policy PDFs.

---

## Outsourced detection and monitoring options
- Virtual SOC subscriptions such as Arctic Wolf, Huntress or Defendify start near $1,000/month for sub-50 seat companies—cheaper than even a part-time analyst.
- Demand service-level clarity: 24/7 alerting, one-hour escalation on critical issues, and monthly playbook alignment sessions to keep context fresh.
- Share a scenario: "Arctic Wolf flags suspicious PowerShell on the marketing laptop—do we investigate or snooze?" Walk the leadership team through the response path now.
- Treat MSSPs as staff augmentation by assigning an internal owner who reviews reports, tunes detections and ensures lessons become updated baselines.
- Bundle basic compliance outputs—GDPR incident logs, SOC 2 evidence folders—so outsourced monitoring directly supports audits rather than adding parallel work.

---

## Lightweight telemetry stack (aka digital breadcrumbs)
- Telemetry is your flight recorder: aggregated logs that reconstruct who did what, when, and from where when something smells off.
- Prioritise identity, endpoint and cloud audit trails first; skip the noisy firewall syslog until you have people to interpret it.
- Choose approachable tooling—open-source Wazuh or Elastic Agent, or affordable SaaS like Panther community or Tines workflows—that integrates alerts and automation without six-figure spend.
- Set retention tiers such as 30 days of hot searchable data and 180 days of cold storage to satisfy regulator or customer inquiries without blowing S3 budgets.
- Enrich alerts automatically with asset owner, data sensitivity and relevant runbook links so responders can move from "what happened?" to "what’s next?" in minutes.

---

## Everyday hygiene culture (keep it human)
- Embed the "have you tried turning it off and on again?" meme into operations hours to normalize quick patch restarts instead of procrastination.
- Publish a monthly hygiene scoreboard showing MFA coverage, patch compliance and phishing-sim click rates; celebrate the teams hitting targets with shout-outs, not shaming.
- Rotate mini-drills so every department experiences a simulated password reset, lost device or SaaS lockout—muscle memory beats policy binders during stress.
- Encourage "see something, say something" with Slack emojis or forms for suspicious emails; reward the first reporter with coffee vouchers to reinforce good instincts.
- Remind the crew: "Security hygiene—like dental hygiene but with fewer cavities and more credentials." Repetition cements culture.

---

## Incident readiness without big spend
- Draft two-page runbooks for ransomware, account takeover and lost devices, mapping decision trees, evidence collection and external counsel contacts.
- Pre-stage crisis comms templates, insurance hotline numbers and legal counsel retainer agreements so you are not googling at 3 a.m. under duress.
- Schedule quarterly tabletop exercises using free CISA or vendor guides; assign clear narrator, responder and observer roles to maintain engagement.
- Capture lessons learned in a shared playbook repository, updating baselines, automation scripts and vendor contacts immediately.
- Align digital forensics steps with legal hold obligations early; even startups may face discovery requests from enterprise customers or regulators.

---

## Real-world failure stories (and recoveries)
- Case 1: A Series A fintech lost six months of revenue when ransomware encrypted production and backups stored in the same cloud zone—3-2-1 backups would have cut downtime to hours.
- Case 2: A biotech lost a seven-figure pharma partnership after failing a basic SOC 2 questionnaire because only 40% of staff used MFA; remediation plus proof regained trust the following quarter.
- Case 3: A hardware startup’s unencrypted demo laptop was stolen at a conference, triggering GDPR reporting and delaying their EU launch by eight weeks.
- Flip side: A small marketing agency stopped a phishing campaign cold because their password manager and security awareness nudges trained staff to report suspicious invoices immediately.
- Share these stories to underline that controls are not academic—they protect cash flow, contracts and credibility.

## 30/60/90-day implementation roadmap
- **Day 0–15:** Inventory devices and SaaS apps; roll out password manager and MFA, so when the CFO can’t log in on day 15 the reset takes 30 seconds instead of a 30-minute IT fire drill.
- **Day 16–30:** Finalize baseline document, communicate expectations, and start DNS filtering pilots while measuring adoption.
- **Day 31–60:** Deploy MDM, automate backups and sign the outsourced SOC contract; rehearse escalation paths with a "suspicious PowerShell" scenario run-through.
- **Day 61–90:** Tune telemetry alerts, run the first tabletop exercise, and complete an access review with board-visible metrics and remediation owners.
- Close each sprint with retro notes so improvements compound without adding headcount.

---

## Metrics the board will back (with benchmarks)
- Track MFA coverage above 95%, device compliance above 90% and mean time to patch critical updates within 24 hours—align these with SOC 2 and cyber insurance requirements.
- Compare cost per secure seat (<$50/user/month for sub-100 companies) against ARR impact from accelerated enterprise deals to prove ROI.
- Report incidents contained internally versus escalated to the MSSP within four hours; highlight trend improvements quarter over quarter.
- Show evidence of continuous improvement: updated baseline documentation, completed training, audit-ready logs and privacy impact assessments.
- Map progress to compliance checklists (GDPR Article 32, SOC 2 CC6, ISO 27001 A.8) so stakeholders see direct contributions to certifications and customer trust.
