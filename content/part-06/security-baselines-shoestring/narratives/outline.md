# Narrative Outline — Security Baselines on a Shoestring

## Tasks
- [x] Prioritise essential controls such as password managers, basic MDM and zero-trust defaults.
- [x] Explain the stakes for phishing, ransomware, compliance questionnaires and startup-scale incidents.
- [x] Note outsourced options like lightweight SOC services and monitoring dashboards.
- [x] Connect humour and culture cues—"have you tried turning it off and on again"—to pragmatic security hygiene.
- [x] Reinforce the 30/60/90 roadmap and board-ready metrics as the confidence-building finale.

## Notes
- Summarise affordable security controls, outsourced SOC options, jargon decoding and lightweight monitoring defaults.
- Bridge segments so identity leads to device hardening, SaaS hygiene feeds detection, and culture primes incident readiness.
