# Slide 8 — Scorecard and documentation

Explain why documentation is part of the exercise. The scorecard’s five weighted dimensions ensure the team balances capability with risk and effort. Encourage quantitative scoring to force comparability, but insist on narrative commentary so that future readers understand context. Cite sources—pricing spreadsheets, SOC 2 letters, customer references—so evidence is traceable.

Model good governance by capturing the decision matrix in a shared workspace that tracks version history. This habit makes audits, board reviews, or future renegotiations easier. When participants flag open risks, have them assign owners and mitigation deadlines. The message: decisions are only as strong as the follow-through plan attached to them.
