# Slide 5 — Preparation checklist

Speaker 1: Prep starts with two vendor dossiers—pricing pages, security briefs, a HubSpot implementation guide if we’re stacking it against Salesforce Service Cloud.
Speaker 2: Everyone gets the same scorecard so debates hit weighting, not whether “reporting” belongs at all.
Speaker 1: Discovery notes keep us anchored in customer pain instead of vendor bingo squares. They’re the antidote to “trust me, it scales.”
Speaker 2: Pre-work matters: each persona brings deal-breaker questions and logs assumptions in the shared doc.
Speaker 1: That discipline keeps the live session on decisions, not rummaging through Slack for missing context.
