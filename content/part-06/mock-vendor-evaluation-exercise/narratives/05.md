# Slide 5 — Preparation checklist

Walk through the artefacts they will receive before the live session. Two vendor dossiers keep the exercise grounded—ideally actual pricing pages or anonymised security reports. Emphasise that a shared scorecard sets expectations around criteria and weights, but participants can debate adjustments if justified. The discovery notes anchor the discussion in customer needs rather than vendor hype.

Set the expectation that pre-work matters. Each persona should arrive with deal-breaker questions and documented assumptions, because real evaluations bog down when stakeholders show up empty-handed. Reinforce good habits: log pre-work in the shared workspace, tag owners, and note what data still needs validation.
