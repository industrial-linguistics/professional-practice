# Slide 10 — Success criteria and follow-through

Anchor the exercise in tangible outcomes. The gold standard is a crisp recommendation memo that could go straight to an executive meeting. Stress that clarity matters more than unanimity—the team may present a preferred option plus a contingency. The executive observer should be able to retell the story independently, which proves the team communicated effectively.

Finally, insist on operationalising the learnings. Templates, negotiation questions, and risk registers should land in the procurement playbook within a day. Book the next mock or live review while momentum is high, and assign an owner to maintain the artefacts. These habits turn a one-off workshop into an enduring capability.
