# Slide 1 — Mock Vendor Evaluation Exercise

Open by reminding participants that procurement muscles at startups are often underdeveloped compared to product or sales. This exercise is their rehearsal room. The goal is to practice running a structured vendor evaluation before real dollars and reputational risk are on the line. Emphasise that the session blends classroom learning with improvisation: we will work from real vendor collateral, negotiate in character, and pressure-test how the group communicates upward.

Draw the link to earlier modules where we stressed intentional vendor management rhythms. A mock evaluation is the bridge from theory to practice. Participants will leave with artefacts—scorecards, negotiation scripts, debrief templates—that they can re-use when the next tooling request lands in Slack. Set the tone as collaborative but rigorous: healthy friction is encouraged, because it surfaces blind spots while the stakes are low.
