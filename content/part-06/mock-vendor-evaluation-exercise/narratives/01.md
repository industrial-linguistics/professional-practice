# Slide 1 — Mock Vendor Evaluation Exercise

Speaker 1: Picture procurement as a dusty kettlebell. Everyone nods at it, no one lifts. Tonight we do.
Speaker 2: But why mock evaluations instead of just diving into real ones?
Speaker 1: Because the last team that skipped rehearsal picked a charming helpdesk, then mid-migration learned it synced five integrations. Fixing that cost double.
Speaker 2: So this is our flight simulator: real decks, fake money, permission to stall safely.
Speaker 1: Exactly—structured reps, a dash of humour, time to flag hype before the next “this will revolutionise your workflow” email.
