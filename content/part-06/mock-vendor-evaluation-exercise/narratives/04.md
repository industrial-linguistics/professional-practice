# Slide 4 — Roles and personas

Speaker 1: The evaluation lead conducts the orchestra—sets tempo, invites dissent, keeps the scorecard honest.
Speaker 2: Finance plays skeptic, probing cost, discount ladders, and what happens when usage blows past the tier.
Speaker 1: Security and compliance are our “department of no, but.” They bring veto power plus mitigations so the plane still flies.
Speaker 2: The support lead guards adoption, change management checklists, and whether onboarding beats last quarter’s fiasco.
Speaker 1: The CEO observer is the storytelling boss. If they can retell your recommendation without notes, you’ve cleared the level.
