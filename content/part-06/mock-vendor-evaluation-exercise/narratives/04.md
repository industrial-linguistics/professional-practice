# Slide 4 — Roles and personas

Introduce the personas and the behaviours you expect from each. The evaluation lead owns the process and must balance speed with rigour. Encourage them to actively solicit dissenting views. The finance partner plays the skeptic on total cost of ownership—license tiers, implementation hours, overage fees, renewals. Security and compliance get to be the “department of no” within reason, asking hard questions about controls but also offering mitigations.

The business sponsor represents frontline needs. They champion usability, adoption risk, and support staff impact. Finally, the CEO or board observer is there to test storytelling: can the team defend their recommendation in plain language? Encourage participants to lean into these personas, using the provided prompts to embody real stakeholder tension.
