# Slide 3 â€” Scenario setup

Paint the scenario vividly so everyone understands the urgency. The startup has outgrown a basic ticketing tool. Enterprise prospects are demanding integrated analytics, CSAT dashboards, and tight CRM sync. The board approved budget but expects a recommendation quickly. This tension gives the exercise relevance: teams often need to decide within weeks while juggling daily operations.

Point out each constraint: the $120K cap forces prioritisation, the SOC 2 requirement brings security scrutiny, and the migration deadline creates pressure to evaluate implementation capacity. Stress that the objective is not just choosing a vendor but documenting why, including risk mitigations. That mindset keeps the role-play grounded in real-world accountability.
