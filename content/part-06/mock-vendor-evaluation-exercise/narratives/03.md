# Slide 3 — Scenario setup

Speaker 1: Context—our support queue has outgrown a scrappy inbox plug-in. We’re weighing Zendesk versus Intercom for the next growth spurt.
Speaker 2: Leadership wants a recommendation in two weeks.
Speaker 1: Ouch, two weeks? That's startup speed for you! We ship releases while running vendor due diligence.
Speaker 2: Budget caps at $120K, SOC 2 is non-negotiable, and migration must land before the holiday spike. It’s like switching planes mid-flight.
Speaker 1: So we document the “why,” not just the “who.” If turbulence hits, the logbook shows our trade-offs and the backup parachute plan.
