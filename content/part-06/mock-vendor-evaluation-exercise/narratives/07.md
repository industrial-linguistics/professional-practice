# Slide 7 — Discussion prompts by phase

Share these prompts as conversation accelerants. In the kick-off, challenge the team to surface hidden assumptions early—especially around migration effort or who will train staff. During breakout analysis, steer attention to product strategy alignment: will the vendor keep up with the roadmap the support team envisions? For negotiation, invite the finance partner to articulate which trade-offs they are willing to make and why.

On the security front, make it acceptable to push for evidence: ask for incident reports, pen test summaries, or clarity on data residency. For the executive pitch, the prompts remind the team that decision-makers care about leading indicators. How will they measure success in 30, 60, and 90 days? Encourage participants to capture answers in the shared notes so the debrief is rooted in observable behaviours.
