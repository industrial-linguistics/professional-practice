# Slide 9 — Debrief structure

Coach facilitators to run a debrief immediately while the experience is fresh. Start with “what worked” to reinforce positive behaviours: transparent note-taking, proactive risk identification, empathetic listening. Transition to “what puzzled us” so the team can air conflicting data or process confusion without blame. Capture each insight in the shared document to normalise documentation discipline.

For action commitments, push for specifics—who will refine the scorecard, who will gather missing security evidence, what policy updates are needed. Close by inviting each persona to reflect on how the exercise felt. Did the finance partner have the data they needed? Did the business sponsor feel heard? This reflection cements lessons and builds trust across functions.
