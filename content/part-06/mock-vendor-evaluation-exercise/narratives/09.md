# Slide 9 — Debrief structure

Speaker 1: Debrief starts with “what worked” so we reinforce behaviour to repeat—transparent notes, quick risk spotting, vendors kept honest.
Speaker 2: Then “what puzzled us.” Perhaps Intercom’s security appendix contradicted the sales pitch or our change management plan felt thin.
Speaker 1: Every insight lands in the shared doc—no hallway wisdom vanishing before Monday.
Speaker 2: Action commitments need names and dates. Who’s refining the scorecard? Who’s booking reference calls for the evaluation?
Speaker 1: Close with feelings check-ins by persona. Did finance feel heard? Did support believe the adoption plan? Reflection locks in trust.
