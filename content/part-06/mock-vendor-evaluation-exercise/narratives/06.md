# Slide 6 — Live role-play flow

Explain the cadence so participants can manage their energy and contributions. The kick-off is where the evaluation lead demonstrates facilitation: they restate the goals, timeline, and decision criteria. During breakout analysis, pairs should annotate collateral, highlight gaps, and capture open questions. Encourage them to work in shared documents to mimic real-time collaboration.

The negotiation simulation is deliberately short to force prioritisation. Finance should push for concessions while the “vendor rep” defends their position using the provided materials. The security challenge is a chance to stress-test incident response claims and data segregation narratives. Finally, the executive pitch pulls everything together. Treat it like a board meeting: concise story, clear recommendation, ready answers for follow-up questions.
