# Slide 6 — Live role-play flow

Speaker 1: Phase one, kick-off—evaluation lead sets the clock, states decision criteria, and assigns who plays the vendor rep.
Speaker 2: Phase two, breakout analysis—we pair up, annotate dossiers, and log gaps in shared notes instead of sticky pads.
Speaker 1: Phase three, negotiation sprint—finance haggles on payment terms while the “vendor” guards implementation scope. Fifteen minutes, zero table-flipping.
Speaker 2: Phase four, security challenge—compliance probes breach history, data residency, and redlines they’d refuse.
Speaker 1: Phase five, executive pitch—we regroup, deliver a tight deck, and field curveballs about migration risk and change management support.
