# Slide 2 â€” Exercise objectives

Clarify exactly what success looks like for the session. We are not trying to memorise a single vendor choice; we are building a repeatable evaluation motion. Participants should understand that they will practice uncovering hidden assumptions, challenging colleagues respectfully, and articulating trade-offs clearly. Highlight that the deliverables include both decisions and the documentation trail that defends those decisions.

Encourage attendees to internalise that risk, cost, and value are collective responsibilities. The objective is to help them leave with confidence that they can brief executives succinctly, back proposals with evidence, and reuse templates when the stakes are higher. Remind them that the artefacts they produce here become the seed of a startup procurement playbook.
