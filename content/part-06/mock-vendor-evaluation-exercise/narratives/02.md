# Slide 2 — Exercise objectives

Speaker 1: Our scoreboard tonight isn’t “pick Zendesk” or “pick Intercom.” It’s “can we run evaluation without drama?”
Speaker 2: We test how well we surface hidden assumptions, negotiate respectfully, and document decisions like adults.
Speaker 1: Exactly. When the Series A board call asks why you chose Vendor A over B, you’ll have receipts instead of vibes.
Speaker 2: And we leave with artefacts—scorecards, negotiation scripts, reference-call checklists—that seed the procurement playbook.
Speaker 1: Plus the muscle memory to brief execs in plain English instead of jargon bingo. That confidence is the real win condition.
