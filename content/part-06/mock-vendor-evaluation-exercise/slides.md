# Mock Vendor Evaluation Exercise
*Stress-test your buying process before money leaves the bank*

---

## Exercise objectives
- Give founders and operators a safe sandbox to practice structured vendor evaluation.
- Surface hidden assumptions about pricing, risk, and cross-functional approvals.
- Build confidence communicating trade-offs to leadership using data and storytelling.
- Produce reusable artefacts: scorecards, escalation templates, and negotiation talking points.

---

## Scenario setup
- **Context:** A fast-growing startup must choose a customer support platform within two weeks.
- **Trigger:** Current tool cannot handle integrations or analytics demanded by new enterprise clients.
- **Constraint:** $120K annual budget cap, SOC 2 requirement, and migration must finish before peak season.
- **Outcome:** Team recommends a vendor to the CEO with documented rationale and risk mitigations.

---

## Roles and personas
- **Evaluation lead (Ops/IT):** Facilitates the process, consolidates findings, owns final brief.
- **Finance partner:** Probes total cost of ownership, discount structures, and contract flexibility.
- **Security & compliance:** Challenges data residency, access controls, and incident response posture.
- **Business sponsor (Support lead):** Champions feature fit, adoption risk, and change management needs.
- **CEO/Board observer:** Joins debrief to test clarity of recommendations and executive readiness.

---

## Preparation checklist
- Circulate two real vendor dossiers: pricing page, security summary, implementation guide, reference quotes.
- Share a common evaluation scorecard template (weights pre-filled but adjustable by the team).
- Provide discovery call notes highlighting must-have integrations and stakeholder priorities.
- Assign pre-work: each role drafts 3 deal-breaker questions and captures assumptions about budget or effort.

---

## Live role-play flow
1. **Kick-off (10 min):** Evaluation lead frames goals, decision deadline, and scoring method.
2. **Breakout analysis (25 min):** Pairs review vendor packets, annotating risks and opportunities.
3. **Negotiation simulation (15 min):** Finance and vendor rep role-play discount and term negotiations.
4. **Security challenge (10 min):** Compliance lead interrogates breach history and data segregation.
5. **Executive pitch (10 min):** Team presents recommendation and backup option to CEO observer.

---

## Discussion prompts by phase
- *Kick-off:* What assumptions are we making about migration effort or internal staffing?
- *Breakout:* Where do vendor roadmaps align or diverge from product strategy in the next 12 months?
- *Negotiation:* Which concessions matter mostâ€”price, implementation support, exit clauses, or SLAs?
- *Security:* What evidence do we need to validate their incident response claims post-contract?
- *Executive pitch:* How will we monitor success in the first 90 days and trigger escalation if needed?

---

## Scorecard and documentation
- Use 5 weighted dimensions: functionality, security/compliance, total cost, implementation effort, vendor viability.
- Require quantitative scores plus qualitative commentary and cited artefacts for each dimension.
- Capture decision matrix in the shared workspace with version history to model governance discipline.
- Flag open risks with owners, mitigations, and required executive decisions before contract signing.

---

## Debrief structure
- **What worked:** Highlight behaviors that drove clarity, cross-functional alignment, or stakeholder empathy.
- **What puzzled us:** Surface conflicting data, unclear responsibilities, or missing inputs.
- **Action commitments:** Document process improvements, follow-up research, or policy updates.
- Close with reflective prompts: How did each role experience the exercise? What would we change next time?

---

## Success criteria and follow-through
- Team delivers a concise recommendation memo with a go/no-go decision and quantified impact.
- Executive observer can articulate trade-offs without referencing the team in the room.
- Updated templates and lessons learned stored in the procurement playbook within 24 hours.
- Schedule the next mock evaluation or live vendor review to keep muscle memory active.
