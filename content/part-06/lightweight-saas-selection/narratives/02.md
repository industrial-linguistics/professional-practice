Speaker 1: Of course, going lightweight isn't free of trade-offs. Integrations are usually stitched together with Zapier or
webhooks that break when APIs change.
Speaker 2: And the compliance story can be thin. Some vendors still only have a SOC 2 Type I report or keep data in a single
region, which rattles enterprise customers.
Speaker 1: Scalability also bites faster than you expectâ€”API rate limits, seat caps, throttled exports.
Speaker 2: Governance tends to be "trust your teammates" rather than granular roles. Boards and auditors eventually demand more
control than these entry tiers offer.
