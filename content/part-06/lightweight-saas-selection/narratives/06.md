Speaker 1: Finance stacks often start with Xero or QuickBooks Online. They are brilliant for multi-currency invoicing, but global
consolidation or complex approvals still need bolt-ons.
Speaker 2: Billing runs through Stripe or Chargebee Essentials. Subscription dunning is polished, yet revenue recognition and tax
calcs remain spreadsheet-driven until you level up. One founder spent quarter-end untangling ASC 606 deferrals across twelve spreadsheets just to satisfy auditors—and the accountant swore the nightmares would stop only after they graduated to a purpose-built rev-rec tool.
Speaker 1: Spend management is where Ramp and Airbase Essentials shine—instant cards, reimbursement automation, real-time budgets.
Speaker 2: The caution is that procurement workflows and SOC reports mature later. If auditors need evidence, you'll spend time
extracting CSVs rather than handing over dashboards.
