Speaker 1: Let's rewind to the "Zoom-to-Teams" migration of 2023. The company adopted Zoom early because it just worked, while
Slack carried the daily chatter.
Speaker 2: Fast forward to 180 staff and a new security-conscious customer base. They rolled out Microsoft 365 for compliance,
which meant duplicate calendars and two separate chat ecosystems.
Speaker 1: Finance spotted duplicate spend. Meanwhile IT worried about eDiscovery and identity fragmentation.
Speaker 2: A migration squad catalogued every recurring meeting, webinar and recording, then mapped them into Teams. Training,
etiquette guides and office hours smoothed the change.
Speaker 1: Afterward they saw real savings and better governance, though they kept Zoom for big external webinars until Teams
caught upâ€”showing that hybrid models can be strategic, not a failure.
