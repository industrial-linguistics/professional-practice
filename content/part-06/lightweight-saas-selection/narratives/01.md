Speaker 1: When you're a 15-person team trying to close your Series A, speed is the currency you trade in. Lightweight SaaS lets
you stand up the tooling you need in a single afternoon instead of waiting for a six-week implementation.
Speaker 2: Exactly. And those usage-based tiers stretch the cash you haveâ€”why commit to 500 seats of an enterprise suite when
you only have 40 people today? That's a lot of empty virtual chairs! You can redirect that spend to hiring or customer acquisition.
Speaker 1: The admin experience matters too. Founders and ops leads can tweak settings without a full-time systems engineer.
Speaker 2: Plus, many of these vendors build for startups. You get templates, community playbooks, even credits programs that
keep you moving without red tape.
