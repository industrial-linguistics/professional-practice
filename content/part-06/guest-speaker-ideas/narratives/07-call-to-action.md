## Call to action

Close the segment by nudging learners to practice outreach. Ask them to draft an email to their dream guestâ€”highlighting the topic fit, proposed format, audience size and how they will make the speaker's time worthwhile. Invite a few volunteers to read their drafts and workshop improvements live. Reinforce that thoughtful preparation and a clear value exchange dramatically increase the hit rate when approaching busy leaders.
