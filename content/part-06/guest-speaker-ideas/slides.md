# Guest Speaker Ideas
*Voices that make the session tangible*

---

## Why bring guest voices?
- Anchor theory in lived experience across fractional leadership, MSP delivery and venture due diligence
- Provide contrasting viewpoints on risk appetite, tooling investments and hiring choices
- Offer networking opportunities for learners seeking mentors or advisory support
- Humanise cautionary tales so teams remember the stakes when shortcuts seem tempting

---

## Fractional CTO perspective
- Share the "first 90 days" playbook: architecture triage, hiring priorities and governance rituals
- Contrast survival tactics for pre-seed scrappiness vs Series B controls
- Highlight pitfalls: unclear decision rights, unpaid discovery work, treating advisory time as unlimited
- Leave learners with a one-page readiness checklist before engaging fractional leaders
- They’ll help you understand why “it works on my machine” isn’t a deployment strategy

---

## Startup-focused MSP account manager
- Illustrate how co-managed support actually runs—handoffs, tooling integration and after-hours cover
- Bring real SLA dashboards and explain what healthy vs risky metrics look like
- Discuss how pricing levers change with headcount, device mix and compliance demands
- Coach teams on running quarterly business reviews that stay actionable instead of salesy
- Learn the difference between “managed services” and “managed chaos”

---

## VC diligence or portfolio operations lead
- Demystify what investors check: security posture, revenue instrumentation, resilience plans
- Explain how IT maturity influences valuation, board confidence and follow-on funding
- Share anonymised red/green flags spotted during data-room reviews
- Encourage founders to build "diligence-ready" documentation habits from day one
- Discover why your investor’s technical due diligence isn’t just checking if you have Wi-Fi

---

## Logistics and prep tips
- Source speakers 6–8 weeks ahead; confirm NDAs and slide usage rights early
- Pair each guest with a learner moderator and prep call agenda
- Provide context briefs: audience maturity, time limits, desired takeaways
- Capture sessions for reuse—secure consent, handle editing, and publish to the cohort hub

---

## Call to action
Ask learners to draft an outreach email to their top-choice speaker and outline the value exchange offered.
We workshop the best pitches live to build confidence in making the ask.
