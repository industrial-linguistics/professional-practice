# Vendor Management Rhythms
*Keep outsourced partners aligned with start-up velocity*

---

## Why cadence matters
- Vendors extend your team but follow different incentives and clocks.
- Predictable rituals surface risks early before they hit customers.
- Rhythm builds trust: expectations, response times, and accountability tighten.

---

## Core meeting cadence
- **Weekly ops sync (30 min):** Ticket queues, blockers, near-term deliverables.
- **Monthly service review (60 min):** KPI scorecard, incident retros, improvement backlog.
- **Quarterly business review (90 min):** Strategic alignment, contract health, roadmap shifts.
- Anchor rituals to billing or release cycles so stakeholders show up prepared.

---

## Designing the scorecard
- Blend **SLAs/SLRs** (uptime, response) with adoption and satisfaction signals.
- Track leading indicators: backlog age, staffing ratios, change failure rate.
- Pull data from shared dashboards; freeze snapshots before each review.
- Use traffic-light status to trigger escalations and executive visibility.

---

## Running the weekly sync
- Start with a three-slide deck: numbers, escalations, upcoming changes.
- Confirm ownership on every red/yellow metric with due dates.
- Capture blockers requiring internal help (access, decisions, budget).
- Close with "no surprises" check: launches, audits, peak demand.

---

## Monthly service review ritual
- Walk through the scorecard trend lines, not just last month's value.
- Highlight incident learnings and verify action item closure.
- Revisit capacity forecasts and staffing assumptions for the next 60 days.
- Agree on 2-3 experiments or optimisations before the next review.

---

## Make-vs-buy guardrails
- Reassess quarterly: does outsourcing still unlock speed or introduce drag?
- Model total cost: subscription, integration effort, shadow teams, compliance overhead.
- Evaluate strategic control: IP sensitivity, customer intimacy, regulatory obligations.
- Document thresholds that trigger RFPs or insourcing explorations.

---

## Case study: Stripe vs. building payments
- **Speed:** Stripe SDKs let you launch in weeks; in-house build requires new headcount.
- **Cost:** Fees look high, but compare to hiring, PCI scope, 24/7 monitoring.
- **Control:** Outsourcing reduces roadmap control; negotiate premium support for reliability.
- **Risk:** Stripe's redundancy is proven; your custom stack must reach the same bar.

---

## Documentation + tooling
- Centralise agendas, scorecards, and action logs in a shared workspace.
- Version notes and decisions to protect institutional memory through turnover.
- Automate reminders via your ticketing or CRM to chase overdue items.
- Store vendor runbooks alongside incident response and onboarding guides.

---

## Takeaways for founders
- Ritualise touchpoints so vendors feel part of the operating rhythm.
- Keep scorecards visible—green metrics get celebrated, red ones trigger swift support.
- Treat make-vs-buy as a living decision, not a one-off slide.
- Document relentlessly; future you (or your successor) will need the receipts.
