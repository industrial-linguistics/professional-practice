## Building a vendor security muscle

Security diligence cannot be outsourced entirely to procurement. Coach learners to treat vendor assessments as ongoing hygiene: request SOC 2 or ISO 27001 reports annually, review penetration-test summaries, and map each control to the data the vendor actually touches. Pair compliance evidence with practical walkthroughs of how encryption keys are managed, how access is revoked when staff leave, and how incident notifications will flow to your team.

Encourage startups to run joint tabletop exercises. Simulate a compromised credential or data-exfiltration alert to confirm who leads, who communicates, and how regulators or customers are notified. These rehearsals expose gaps in logging, monitoring, or contractual commitments. Fold the outputs into the same scorecards that track uptime so security posture has equal visibility.
