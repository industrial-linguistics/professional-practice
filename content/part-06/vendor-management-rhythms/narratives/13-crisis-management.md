## Preparing for vendor crises

Even the strongest vendor relationship will experience a wobble. Coach learners to pre-build an incident response playbook shared across organisations: who is on the escalation ladder, which Slack or Teams channel lights up first, and how decisions are documented in the heat of the moment. Align on authority to pause deployments, issue customer communications, and pull in legal or compliance.

Encourage quarterly simulations that mirror their worst nightmares: outage during peak season, security breach, or sudden vendor staff attrition. After each drill, capture lessons learned and plug them into scorecards and retrospectives. The goal is to reduce reaction time when a real crisis hits and keep leadership confidence high even under pressure.
