## Establishing cadence rituals

Coming out of the "why rhythms matter" segment, we hand learners a concrete operating drumbeat they can deploy on Monday. We outline a three-tier rhythm that keeps partners plugged into strategy and execution. Weekly operations syncs are deliberately short and tactical: review ticket queues, note any SLA breaches, and unblock near-term tasks. Monthly service reviews go a level higher to interrogate trend lines, incident learnings, and improvement experiments. Quarterly business reviews reconnect the relationship to company strategy, budgets, and roadmap shifts.

Emphasise that cadence is anchored to meaningful triggers. Align the weekly call before your release deploys, schedule the monthly review after financial close so real cost data is available, and run the quarterly session ahead of contract renewal windows. When rituals connect to existing beats, the right stakeholders attend prepared instead of treating meetings as optional. Close every meeting by logging owners, deadlines, and notes in the shared workspace so momentum compounds instead of evaporating between calls.
