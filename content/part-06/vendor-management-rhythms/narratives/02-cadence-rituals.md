## Establishing cadence rituals

We outline a three-tier rhythm that keeps partners plugged into strategy and execution. Weekly operations syncs are deliberately short and tactical: review ticket queues, note any SLA breaches, and unblock near-term tasks. Monthly service reviews go a level higher to interrogate trend lines, incident learnings, and improvement experiments. Quarterly business reviews reconnect the relationship to company strategy, budgets, and roadmap shifts.

Emphasise that cadence is anchored to meaningful triggers. Align the weekly call before your release deploys, schedule the monthly review after financial close so real cost data is available, and run the quarterly session ahead of contract renewal windows. When rituals connect to existing beats, the right stakeholders attend prepared instead of treating meetings as optional.
