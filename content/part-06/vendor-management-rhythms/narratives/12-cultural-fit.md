## Evaluating cultural fit before you sign

Cultural fit sounds squishy, but it dictates execution speed. Encourage founders to meet the delivery leads, project managers, and senior ICs who will work with them daily. Observe how the vendor runs stand-ups, documents decisions, and handles retrospectives. If their operating cadence feels slower or more hierarchical than yours, that friction will surface the first time you need a hotfix on a weekend.

Suggest trial sprints or limited-scope pilots to test collaboration chemistry safely. Track responsiveness to Slack pings, clarity of written updates, and willingness to share bad news quickly. Those signals matter as much as price because they predict whether the vendor can blend into your existing rituals without constant policing.
