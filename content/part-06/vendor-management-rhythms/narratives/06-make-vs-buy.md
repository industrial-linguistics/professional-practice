## Make-vs-buy as a living decision

Start-ups often make an initial outsourcing decision under extreme time pressure. Remind learners that the calculus shifts as product-market fit solidifies, customer expectations rise, and internal capabilities mature. A quarterly make-vs-buy checkpoint keeps leaders honest about whether the vendor still unlocks speed or has become drag.

Walk through the dimensions: total cost of ownership (subscription, integration, shadow teams, compliance overhead), strategic control (IP sensitivity, customer intimacy, regulatory obligations), and risk posture (single points of failure, vendor financial health, data residency). Encourage teams to set quantitative thresholds—like customer volume or margin targets—that trigger formal RFPs or insourcing investigations.
