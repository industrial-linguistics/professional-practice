Wrap the segment by connecting rituals to resilience. When vendors share the same cadence as the core team, surprises shrink and response times improve. Scorecards turn debates into collaborative problem solving. A living make-vs-buy framework ensures the relationship continues to serve strategy rather than legacy decisions.
