## Monthly service review ritual

Monthly reviews zoom out far enough to connect operational health with strategic priorities. Encourage facilitators to lead with trend lines: three months of SLA performance, cost variance, and satisfaction scores. From there, walk through incidents—what we learned, how remediations are tracking, and whether they require executive support.

Capacity planning is a key section. Challenge vendors to bring forward-looking staffing plans, upcoming maintenance windows, and assumptions about ticket volumes. Close the review by committing to two or three improvement experiments, assigning owners, and noting when results will be assessed. That loop converts the meeting from reporting theatre into a driver of continuous improvement.
