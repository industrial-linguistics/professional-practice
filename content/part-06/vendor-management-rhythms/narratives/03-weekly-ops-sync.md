## Running the weekly ops sync

The weekly sync should feel like a high-signal stand-up, not a status monologue. Encourage learners to cap the session at 30 minutes with a three-slide deck: performance snapshot, escalations, and upcoming changes. Assign owners to every yellow or red metric before the call ends and log due dates in the shared tracker. Anything without a name or deadline will resurface as an incident later.

Use the final minutes for a "no surprises" scan. Ask explicitly about launches, audits, marketing campaigns, or staffing changes that could impact capacity. Offer a concrete prompt: "We're launching the Black Friday campaign next week and expect 10x traffic—can your monitoring handle the alert volume?" That habit gives vendors permission to flag constraints before they become outages and reinforces that the start-up wants partnership, not heroics. It also prevents the 3 a.m. vendor panic call that starts with "We didn't know you were deploying today...".
