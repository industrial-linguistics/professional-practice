## Building a meaningful scorecard

Scorecards convert gut feel into shared evidence. Coach learners to combine SLA/SLR metrics—response time, resolution time, uptime—with adoption and satisfaction data such as NPS from internal stakeholders or product usage analytics. Leading indicators like backlog age, staffing ratios, and change failure rate provide early warning signals before contractual breaches occur.

Stress the importance of data hygiene. Partners should pull metrics from a single source of truth, snapshot them before the review, and annotate anomalies. Colour coding helps executives parse quickly, but it must link to predefined thresholds that automatically trigger escalation or executive awareness. The scorecard becomes a living document for accountability.

Show an example template to make the abstract concrete: availability ≥99.9% stays green, 99.5–99.89% is yellow, anything lower turns red. Pair that with first-response targets (green <15 minutes for P1 tickets), change failure rate bands (<10% green, 10–20% yellow), backlog age for critical tickets (<3 days green), stakeholder NPS (≥50 green), and compliance evidence status. When facilitators can point to six crisp metrics with thresholds, learners understand how to translate principles into dashboards.
