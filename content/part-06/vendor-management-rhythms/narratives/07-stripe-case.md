## Stripe versus build-your-own payments

Use the payments example to make the framework tangible. Stripe lets a lean team accept money quickly with globally resilient infrastructure, built-in fraud tooling, and compliance coverage. The trade-off is ongoing transaction fees and limited influence over the roadmap. Building in-house grants total control but requires hiring specialised engineers, gaining PCI certification, and running 24/7 monitoring from day one.

Invite learners to map the four lenses: speed to market, cost structure, control, and risk. Highlight that "cost" is more than fees—it is also opportunity cost of delayed launches. Similarly, "control" includes the ability to adapt to local regulations or bespoke checkout flows. Close by asking the cohort when they would trigger a revisit—perhaps crossing $100M GMV or expanding into complex billing models.

Prompt discussion with a forward-looking question: if Stripe announced a material price hike tomorrow, which leading indicators would tell you it's time to diversify payment providers before customers feel pain?
