## Documentation and accountability habits

Documentation is the connective tissue that keeps vendor rhythms effective as teams grow. Reinforce that every meeting produces a shared note: agenda, decisions, owners, and deadlines. Store artefacts in a central workspace alongside scorecards, contracts, runbooks, and escalation matrices. That repository becomes the onboarding kit for new hires and a safeguard during audits or fundraising.

Encourage lightweight automation. Integrate the action log with your ticketing tool or CRM so reminders fire without manual chasing. Use templated scorecards and meeting notes to reduce admin overhead. The goal is to make good governance the default path, not additional labour.

Remind facilitators that future-you will thank present-you for taking notes—future-you is notoriously impatient with mystery decisions.
