## Negotiating contracts that protect momentum

Contracts are operating tools, not just legal formalities. Help learners differentiate service-level agreements (SLAs) that commit to performance and service-level reports (SLRs) that provide transparency. Push for clear remediation timelines, service credits tied to business impact, and escalation ladders that reach executives when targets are missed.

Include exit strategies in the negotiation checklist. Define how data is exported, how knowledge transfer occurs, and how long the vendor will support your migration. Cap annual price uplifts and require advance notice for material changes. When founders see contracts as living documents aligned to their rhythms, they negotiate clauses that keep partners responsive instead of adversarial.
