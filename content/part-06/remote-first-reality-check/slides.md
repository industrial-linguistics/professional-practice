title: Remote-First Reality Check
---

# Remote-First Reality Check
*Designing onboarding, logistics and rituals for a distributed team*

---

## What "remote-first" really means
- Operations, tooling and decisions assume no shared office baseline
- Misconception: "remote allowed" policies but HQ-only approvals and walk-up support
- Remote-first makes IT the new facilities team: devices, access, and rituals must travel
- Why it matters: reliability, compliance and employee confidence begin with us

---

## First 30 days onboarding map
- Pre-day 0: contract + ID + hardware shipment with welcome doc + checklist template
- Week 1: async orientation modules led by People Ops; buddies own the first live touchpoint
- Week 2: engineering/ops leads run recorded shadowing playlists by function
- Week 3–4: manager + mentor co-review first deliverables; measure time-to-first-commit/story
- Success metrics: access ready on day 1, first task shipped within 14 days, CSAT ≥ 4.5/5

---

## Device and access logistics
- Maintain persona-based hardware buffers with zero-touch images and tamper seals
- Regional depot partners handle RMA swaps; Sarah in Berlin had a twin MacBook by Thursday
- $800–$1,200 BYOD stipend plus MDM enrollment prevents gaming rigs from hitting prod
- "Most teams are remote-friendly until a laptop dies in Mumbai at 3am." Seen that week-long customs saga?
- Humor beats panic: nothing says "welcome" like a device touring three customs warehouses

---

## Secure joiner/mover/leaver runbooks
- Automate account creation from HRIS/contract tracker with least-privilege bundles
- Include VPN, SSO, MFA, password manager setup in the welcome packet video
- Deprovision within 2 hours of notice (immediate for terminations); automation revoked Maria's access minutes after HR closed her contract
- Keep third-party SaaS inventories so MSPs can disable access without hunting spreadsheets

---

## Contractor-heavy teams
- Issue company-managed identities; never hand out a founder's admin login
- Require data-handling agreements and country-specific compliance addenda
- When Maria's design contract ended, automation revoked Figma, Slack and VPN within minutes
- If expense approvals take 6 weeks, expect a private Dropbox empire—fix the process instead
- Pair every engagement with return labels and hardware trackers so gear comes home

---

## Time zone choreography
- Publish coverage map + core collaboration hours (e.g. 2pm–5pm UTC) with escalation paths
- Follow-the-sun handover templates saved us when London found a 6pm bug before Sydney woke up
- Record key meetings with timestamped notes; ask: how many of you survived the "quick" 2am sync?
- We learned the hard way that "quick sync" at 2am Melbourne time isn't quick for anyone—sleep > sprint planning

---

## Virtual support operations
- Run help desk inside chat with triage bots, KB links and emoji status reactions
- Offer video office hours and chase a "first-day fix" goal for remote incidents
- Stock spare devices at regional MSP lockers to hit 48-hour replacement targets
- Track shipping SLAs, customs delays and ticket MTTR as joint KPIs

---

## From operations to culture
- Logistical excellence signals trust: people share context when devices arrive ready to work
- Async rituals thrive when onboarding removes guesswork about tools and access
- Bridge statement: strong runbooks free managers to focus on belonging, not badge provisioning

---

## Culture and belonging
- Pair each starter with a culture buddy outside their reporting line for social proof
- Host monthly "operations show-and-tell" to surface small tweaks and celebrate experiments
- Fund in-person micro-retreats by region when >8 contributors cluster nearby
- Rotate facilitation of async updates so every voice practices storytelling

---

## Health metrics to track
- Onboarding satisfaction score from first 45-day survey
- Hardware delivery lead time by geography vs. target of <5 business days
- Percentage of roles with documented SOPs, video walkthroughs and owners
- Support MTTR for remote device issues and access resets

---

## Common failure patterns
- Laptop arrives late; new hire spends week one chasing access while shadow IT blooms
- Contractors keep local copies because shared storage lags and expense approvals take 6 weeks
- Leaders schedule 10pm status calls "just this once" until burnout arrives—people prefer sleep
- How many projects have you seen derailed by a customs delay or a missing VPN token?

---

## Action checklist
- Audit remote onboarding artefacts and fill gaps before the next cohort starts
- Sign agreements with regional logistics and e-waste partners now
- Automate offboarding triggers for payroll, SaaS and physical assets
- Review quiet hours, stipends and retreat budgets every quarter
