title: Remote-First Reality Check
---

# Remote-First Reality Check
*Designing onboarding, logistics and rituals for a distributed team*

---

## Remote-first ≠ "remote allowed"
- Treat remote as the default, not an exception for a few hires
- Build processes that do not rely on walking to someone's desk
- Document everything so contractors and employees share the same playbook
- Budget for shipping, stipends and tooling the way you budget for rent

---

## First 30 days onboarding map
- Pre-day 0: confirm contract, collect ID, ship hardware, pre-provision accounts
- Week 1: async orientation modules, buddy calls, recorded platform tours
- Week 2: shadowing via call recordings, pair sessions across time zones
- Week 3–4: first independent deliverables with scheduled feedback windows

---

## Device and access logistics
- Maintain a hardware buffer by persona with standard images and tamper seals
- Use MDM with zero-touch enrollment plus regional depot partners for RMA swaps
- Provide $800–$1,200 workstation stipend when BYOD is unavoidable
- Track shipping chain-of-custody, customs paperwork and return labels up front

---

## Secure joiner/mover/leaver runbooks
- Automate account creation triggered from HRIS or contract tracker
- Bundle VPN, SSO, MFA tokens and password manager setup in the welcome packet
- Define deprovisioning SLAs: within 2 hours for voluntary exits, immediate for terminations
- Maintain access maps so MSPs can disable third-party SaaS within minutes

---

## Contractor-heavy teams
- Issue company-managed identities; never share a founder's credentials
- Require signed data handling agreements and country-specific compliance addenda
- Rotate access reviews quarterly to capture contractor churn and scope creep
- Offer tool walkthrough videos so short-term specialists ramp without hand-holding

---

## Time zone choreography
- Publish team coverage map and core collaboration hours (e.g. 2pm–5pm UTC)
- Use follow-the-sun handover templates to pass context without meetings
- Record key meetings and provide timestamped notes for async catch-up
- Respect quiet hours with delayed-send defaults and escalation-only paging

---

## Virtual support operations
- Run the help desk inside chat with triage bots and clear escalation keywords
- Offer video office hours and "first-day fix" goals for remote incidents
- Keep spare devices at regional MSP lockers to hit 48-hour replacement targets
- Monitor shipping SLAs and customs delays as KPIs, not just ticket closure

---

## Culture and belonging
- Pair every new starter with a culture buddy outside their reporting line
- Host monthly "operations show-and-tell" to surface process tweaks
- Fund in-person micro-retreats by region when >8 contributors cluster nearby
- Rotate facilitation of async updates so all voices practice storytelling

---

## Health metrics to track
- Onboarding satisfaction score from first 45-day survey
- Hardware delivery lead time by geography vs. target of <5 business days
- Percentage of roles with documented SOPs and video walkthroughs
- Support MTTR for remote device issues and access resets

---

## Common failure patterns
- Laptop arrives late and new hire spends week one chasing access
- Contractors keep local copies of data because shared storage is slow
- Leaders schedule 10pm status calls "just this once" until burnout arrives
- Shadow IT blooms when purchasing reimbursements take months

---

## Action checklist
- Audit remote onboarding artefacts and fill gaps before the next cohort
- Sign agreements with regional logistics and e-waste partners now
- Automate offboarding triggers for payroll, SaaS and physical assets
- Review quiet hours, stipends and retreat budgets every quarter
