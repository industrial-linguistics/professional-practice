Speaker 2: North America throws a state-by-state puzzle at you—California, Quebec, New York cybersecurity regs. Plus the SEC now expects rapid incident disclosures.
Speaker 1: APAC has its own texture: Singapore's PDPA accountability principle, India's new DPDP consent clauses, Japan's APPI transfer logs.
Speaker 2: And don't forget LATAM and the Gulf—Brazil's LGPD clock starts ticking the moment you detect an incident, while Saudi's PDPL cares deeply about localisation.
