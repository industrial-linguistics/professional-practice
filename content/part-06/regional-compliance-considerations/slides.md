# Regional Compliance Considerations
*Designing policies that keep pace with global ambitions*

---

## Why compliance shows up early
- Global customers expect privacy, payments and data stewardship even when your team fits around one table.
- Regulators now benchmark start-ups against the same playbooks as incumbents—think GDPR Article 5 or the Australian Privacy Act APP 11.
- Founders promising "enterprise-ready" need evidence before procurement clears the contract.

---

## Core regulatory pillars to track
- **Privacy** – consent, breach notification windows, subject rights (GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, LGPD, Privacy Act).
- **Payments** – PCI DSS, local acquiring bank rules, strong customer authentication (PSD2 SCA, RBI UPI guidelines).
- **Data residency** – customer commitments, localisation mandates (e.g., German health data, Indonesian PP No. 71).
- **Sector overlays** – HIPAA for health data, SOCI Act in Australia, NZ Privacy Principle 12 for cross-border disclosure.

---

## Mapping obligations by region
- **EU/UK** – lawful basis, Data Protection Impact Assessments, Standard Contractual Clauses post-Schrems II.
- **North America** – state-level patchwork (California, Quebec), FTC and SEC breach disclosure expectations.
- **APAC** – Singapore PDPA's accountability principle, India's DPDP Act consent language, Japan APPI data transfer records.
- **LATAM & MENA** – Brazil's LGPD reporting timelines, Saudi PDPL data localisation, South Africa POPIA operator agreements.

---

## Contracts drive the fine print
- Enterprise customers add bespoke clauses: data deletion timeframes, sub-processor notifications, right-to-audit.
- Payments and marketplace partners may require specific attestations or quarterly scans before enabling production keys.
- Map contract promises back to operational runbooks so customer success and engineering know what “within 24 hours” really means.

---

## From scrappy habits to governed processes
- Early stage: personal Dropbox, shared LastPass vaults, "we'll fix it later" change control.
- Scaling stage: DPA templates, ROPA inventories, access reviews logged in Jira, quarterly compliance check-ins.
- Mature stage: dedicated privacy counsel, regional data stewards, automated evidence collection for audits.

---

## The Dropbox-to-retention-policy glow-up
- Joking aside, migrating from "CEO's personal Dropbox" to a documented retention schedule avoids fines *and* awkward board chats.
- Use humour to normalise the shift: "Remember when invoices lived in someone's Downloads folder? Our audit trail finally moved out of the sharehouse." 
- Celebrate wins when teams adopt structured repositories with lifecycle rules.

---

## Building the compliance roadmap
- Start with a risk register that flags applicable laws, contractual obligations and customer commitments.
- Prioritise controls by sales pipeline: "EU launch" unlocks DPIA work, "Health-tech pilot" triggers HIPAA assessments.
- Assign owners: legal on policy, security on technical controls, ops on evidence capture.

---

## Tooling and automation tips
- Centralise policies and records in a governance platform or even well-tagged Notion space.
- Automate data classification and DSR intake through help desk workflows or custom forms.
- Use cloud provider region controls, key management and logging to enforce residency and prove access history.

---

## Partnering with regional experts
- Tap fractional privacy officers, local counsel or MSPs when entering new jurisdictions.
- Join industry associations (AISA, IAPP, CSA) for playbooks and peer insight.
- Budget for translation/localisation of policies and customer notices—compliance is also about tone and accessibility.

---

## Key takeaway
You do not need a 40-person compliance department, but you do need intentional guardrails. Map obligations, mature practices deliberately, and make that Dropbox joke the turning point where governance finally catches up with global reach.
