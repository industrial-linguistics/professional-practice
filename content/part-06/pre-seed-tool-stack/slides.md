# Pre-Seed Tool Stack Example
*Stay lean without starving operations*

---

## Why a curated pre-seed stack?
- Keeps the founding team focused on shipping product instead of chasing logins.
- Shows investors and early customers you have basic governance covered.
- Avoids the "try every tool" chaos that quietly burns $500+/month.
- Creates artefacts—templates, rituals, admin settings—that scale into Series A.

---

## Runway guardrails
- Budget baseline: ~$200/month for 6–8 active seats.
- Optimise for tools that bundle multiple workflows (email + drive + calendar).
- Prefer monthly billing until product-market fit is clearer.
- Track true cost-to-serve: count founders, contractors and bots that consume paid seats.
- Typical trap: founder signs up for Asana, designer wants Figma, engineer prefers Jira—suddenly you're burning $150/month on tools that do not sync.

---

## Communication & identity core
- **Google Workspace Business Starter – $72**: email, calendar, Drive with basic admin controls.
- **Slack Pro – $54**: async conversations, searchable history, guest channels.
- Decision cue: stay on Starter/Pro tiers until customers demand SSO or retention beyond 90 days.
- If procurement pushes for Microsoft 365 parity, document the total migration lift before agreeing.
- Capture GDPR and Australian Privacy Act considerations early, including where primary data resides and which regions host backups.

---

## Knowledge & project heartbeat
- **Notion Plus – $32**: shared wiki, lightweight project tracking, investor update templates.
- **Airtable Team – $20**: structured CRM-lite, partnership pipeline, lightweight inventory tracking.
- Resist the urge to split into six niche apps; combine databases and pages before expanding.
- Revisit seat counts monthly—viewers can stay free while editors hold licences.
- Build standard operating procedures and onboarding playbooks here so new hires land smoothly within week one.

---

## Security & access hygiene
- **1Password Teams Starter – $24**: vault per function, onboarding checklists, emergency access.
- Enforce hardware security keys via Google Advanced Protection only after a high-risk trigger.
- Enable Google Workspace context-aware access instead of buying a dedicated CASB this early.
- Document joiner/mover/leaver steps in Notion to make offboarding a 10-minute ritual.
- Scenario: contractor Sarah offboards a dev, but without the checklist they keep Drive access six months later—privacy review nightmare.

---

## Optional add-ons when justified
- **Calendly Teams (pay-per-user)** once demo volume >10/week and founders become scheduling bottlenecks—because nobody wants to spend more time scheduling meetings than having them.
- **Gusto or Rippling contractor payroll** when payments exceed quarterly manual workflows.
- **Freshdesk Growth** if support volume surpasses shared inbox discipline.
- Map API/SSO integrations before adding tools so automation flows stay intact and you avoid integration debt.
- Tie every add-on to a measurable pain point with a sunset review date.

---

## Moments to resist the upsell
- Slack enterprise grid demo? Decline until a signed enterprise customer mandates compliance exports.
- Google Workspace upgrade emails? Stay put until storage or legal hold needs are real.
- Vendors offering "founder discounts" for 24-month commitments—compare to the cash runway impact.
- When a board advisor insists on a tool, ask them to map the exact control gap it closes.
- Example: Slack touts 99.99% uptime on Enterprise, but your Pro plan already meets customer SLAs—keep the cash.

---

## Customise without losing discipline
- Swap Google Workspace for Microsoft 365 only if your product already depends on Azure AD.
- Replace Airtable with HubSpot Starter when marketing automation is a priority.
- Document why each substitution preserves the $200/month guardrail.
- Keep a single source of truth for domains, billing owners and renewal dates.
- Maintain exit plans: note export formats, backup cadence and how you unwind vendor lock-in before upgrading.

---

## Workshop exercise for learners
- Draft your own six-tool stack under $250/month and justify each choice.
- Identify the trigger that would force an upgrade or extra tool.
- Note which roles (founder, ops lead, fractional CTO) own configuration and governance.
- Present back with a "stay lean" checklist to pressure-test with peers.

---

## Key takeaway
Start with a deliberate, budget-conscious stack that covers collaboration, knowledge, security and customer touchpoints.
Treat every new tool as an experiment with an exit plan so cash burn stays aligned with runway.
