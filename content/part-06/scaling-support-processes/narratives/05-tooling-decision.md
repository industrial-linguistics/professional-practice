Speaker 1: Let’s tackle the tooling debate. ServiceNow or Jira Service Management—what’s the difference in practice?
Speaker 2: ServiceNow shines when you need rigid workflows, integrated CMDB and audit-grade change control. But it demands budget and a specialist admin.
Speaker 1: Jira Service Management snaps into existing Atlassian workflows and ships with great automation and developer visibility.
Speaker 2: The trade-off? You may need marketplace apps for CMDB depth and more governance features. So we map regulatory needs, current stack, and admin skills before deciding.
