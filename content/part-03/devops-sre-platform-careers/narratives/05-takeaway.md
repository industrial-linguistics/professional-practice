Speaker 1: Each path offers room to grow from hands-on engineer to strategic leader. Small startups might only have one or two DevOps generalists, while mid-sized companies carve out dedicated SRE and platform teams.
Speaker 2: Certification in AWS, GCP or Kubernetes can open doors, and these roles are famously remote friendly. Junior positions may start around $70k–$90k, but with experience you can progress to staff or principal levels well above $150k. The work suits people who enjoy solving problems and communicating across teams, whether you're building pipelines, enforcing reliability or crafting the internal tools that enable self-service. The industry demand keeps increasing, so shifting between these paths—or combining them—is a common career progression.
