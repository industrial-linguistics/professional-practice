Speaker 1: Each path offers room to grow from hands-on engineer to strategic leader. Small start-ups might only have one or two DevOps generalists, while mid-sized companies carve out dedicated SRE and platform teams. Large enterprises can support whole divisions focused on reliability or internal tooling.
Speaker 2: Certifications in AWS, GCP or Kubernetes help you stand out, and remote-friendly cultures mean geography is less of a barrier. Expect the occasional on-call rotation, but flexible hours are common. Junior roles start around $70kâ€“$90k and can rise above $150k as you progress to staff or principal levels. These careers reward people who enjoy problem solving, clear communication and continuous learning. Diversity and inclusion efforts are improving, yet more participation from underrepresented groups is still needed. Whether you specialise or blend all three paths, the demand for automation and reliability skills keeps climbing.
