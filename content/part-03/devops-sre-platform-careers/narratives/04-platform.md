Speaker 1: Platform engineers provide the reusable tooling that keeps teams productive. Think of them as the people building the roads and traffic lights so everyone else can drive smoothly. A platform engineer might design Kubernetes templates, manage golden AMIs, or maintain an internal developer portal like Backstage.
Speaker 2: Many come from DevOps or SRE roles and find they enjoy building shared services more than maintaining individual projects. Salaries often start around $90k and can reach $150k for senior architects. Good platform engineers have empathy for developers and a knack for system design. In small startups you rarely see dedicated platform teams, but in large enterprises they might number twenty or more. Over time you can grow into a platform architect or even product manager role. Remember, nobody notices the road builders until there's a pothole!
