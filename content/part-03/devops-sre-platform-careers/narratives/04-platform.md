Speaker 1: Platform engineers provide the reusable tooling that keeps teams productive. Think of them as the people building the roads and traffic lights so everyone else can drive smoothly. A platform engineer might design Kubernetes templates, manage golden AMIs or maintain an internal developer portal. Spotify's Backstage project is a great example of tooling that began inside one company and became open source for all.
Speaker 2: Many platform engineers come from DevOps or SRE backgrounds and discover they love building shared services more than maintaining single applications. Empathy for developers, an eye for system design and a dash of product thinking all help. Salaries often start around $90k and can reach $150k for senior architects, especially if you hold cloud certifications. Larger enterprises may have teams of twenty or more, while small start-ups rely on a single expert. Over time you can grow into a platform architect or product manager role. Remember, nobody notices the road builders until there's a pothole!
