Speaker 1: DevOps, SRE and platform engineering roles all grew from the need to ship software quickly without breaking things. Ten years ago you would rarely see these titles outside of tech giants. If you told someone you were a DevOps engineer, they might have asked if you fixed printers. Companies like Netflix and Google proved that automation and tight feedback loops were essential at scale.
Speaker 2: The roles overlap, yet each leans in a different direction. DevOps engineers build the pipelines and smooth collaboration between development and operations. SREs stand guard over reliability by codifying incidents and measuring service levels. Platform engineers design the internal tools and "paved roads" that keep everyone productive. All three paths are in high demand, often remote friendly, and pay well once you've mastered the tooling.
