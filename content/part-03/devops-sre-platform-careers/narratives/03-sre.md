Speaker 1: Site reliability engineers take system stability to heart. The discipline grew out of Google's need to manage massive scale, so it's all about automation and repeatable operations. An SRE might spend mornings writing Kubernetes operators and afternoons running chaos experiments or tuning Prometheus alerts.
Speaker 2: Most come from software engineering or DevOps backgrounds and are comfortable coding and troubleshooting production issues. Entry salaries often start near $80k but staff and principal SREs can exceed $140k. They live by the motto "Hope is not a strategy," so they design runbooks, set service level objectives and rotate on-call duty through tools like PagerDuty. Larger companies maintain dedicated SRE teams, while smaller firms might rely on a handful of specialists. Successful SREs remain calm under pressure and obsess over metrics to keep services healthy.
