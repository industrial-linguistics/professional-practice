Speaker 1: Site reliability engineers take system stability to heart. The discipline grew out of Google's need to manage massive scale, so it's all about automation and repeatable operations. An SRE might spend mornings writing Kubernetes operators and afternoons running chaos experiments or tuning Prometheus alerts. When Netflix battled early outages, their SREs pioneered chaos engineering to strengthen resilience.
Speaker 2: Most SREs come from software or DevOps backgrounds and are comfortable coding and troubleshooting production issues. They remain calm when a 3â€¯AM page arrives and excel at communicating what went wrong. Certifications such as Google's Professional Cloud DevOps Engineer bolster credibility. Entry salaries start near $80k, but staff and principal SREs can exceed $140k. On-call rotations and incident retrospectives are part of the culture, though many teams are remote friendly. Large companies maintain dedicated SRE squads, while smaller firms rely on a handful of specialists who obsess over metrics to keep services healthy.
