Speaker 1: DevOps engineers craft the pipelines that move code from commit to production. On a typical day they'll wire up Jenkins or GitLab CI jobs, containerize apps with Docker and script AWS deployments. Their motto: "It works on my machine" is not an acceptable release strategy.
Speaker 2: Most start as system administrators or developers who discover a knack for automation. Junior salaries hover around $70k but can climb past $120k as you progress into senior or lead roles. The role demands a problem-solving mindset and strong communication because you spend your time bridging teams. In small startups you might be a team of one, whereas large enterprises build DevOps groups of five or more. Career progression often leads to DevOps architect or engineering manager positions.
