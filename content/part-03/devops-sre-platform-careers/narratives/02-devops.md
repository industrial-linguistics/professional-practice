Speaker 1: DevOps engineers craft the pipelines that move code from commit to production. A normal day might involve wiring up GitHub Actions or Jenkins jobs, containerising apps with Docker and debugging a failed deployment at 3â€¯AM. Their motto: "It works on my machine" is not an acceptable release strategy.
Speaker 2: Most start as system administrators or developers who discover a knack for automation. They thrive on curiosity, clear communication and comfort with ambiguity. Certifications like AWS DevOps Professional or the Kubernetes CKAD help them progress. Junior salaries hover around $70k but can climb past $120k in senior roles, often with remote work and on-call rotations. Small startups may have one DevOps generalist, while large enterprises build teams of five or more. Over time you can grow into architect or engineering manager positions and contribute to open source tooling along the way.
