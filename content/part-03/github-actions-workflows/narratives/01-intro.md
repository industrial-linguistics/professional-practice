Speaker 1: Before tools like GitHub Actions, teams often had to manually copy files to servers every time something changed. GitHub Actions puts an end to that headache by running your automation directly from the repository. Whenever code is pushed or a pull request opens, the workflow springs to life automatically.

Every bug fix or new feature passes through the same checks, and newcomers can easily understand the process just by reading the file.
