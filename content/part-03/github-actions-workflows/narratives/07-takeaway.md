Speaker 2: When teams treat workflows like code, automation evolves right alongside the project. Each improvement is recorded in version control so you always know why something changed.

Speaker 1: GitHub Actions brings that automation directly into the repository. Build steps, tests, deployments and notifications all happen in a single, auditable place. You get faster releases, fewer mistakes and clear visibility for everyone involved.

Speaker 2: Whether youâ€™re supporting a small website or a complex enterprise system, the key takeaway is simple: start small, keep iterating and let the platform handle the repetition so you can focus on delivering value.
