Speaker 1: Workflows can do more than testsâ€”they can deploy applications to staging or production. By using environments with required reviewers, you prevent accidental releases. Think of it as a bouncer checking IDs before any code goes live.
Speaker 2: Many cloud providers publish ready-made actions, making it easy to create or tear down infrastructure on demand. The workflow can also fire off chat or email alerts so everyone stays in the loop. Keep each job focused and grant only the permissions it really needs. Watching run times helps you detect slow steps before they frustrate the team.
