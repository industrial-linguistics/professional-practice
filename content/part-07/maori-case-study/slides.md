# Te Hiku Media Case Study
*Community-led AI that keeps te reo Māori under Māori control*

---

## Why Te Hiku?
- Iwi-owned broadcaster headquartered in Kaitaia, Aotearoa
- Mission: revitalise te reo Māori through digital storytelling
- Built voice-tech assets after decades of community archiving
- Faced pressure from Big Tech to share language corpora for free

---

## Kaupapa Māori foundations
- Guidance from Te Hiku's kaumātua and Kaitiakitanga licence
- Data treated as taonga; consent grounded in whakapapa obligations
- Governance board spans iwi leaders, technologists and legal advisors
- Community hui confirm priorities before any tech deployment

---

## Building the language corpus
- Collected 300,000+ sentences via community recording campaigns
- Created Papakupu (lexicon) and automated speech recognition models
- Engineers partnered with linguists and cultural advisors on prompts
- Contributors retain rights; licence restricts extractive reuse

---

## Tech stack and roles
- Product team: ML engineers, data stewards, cultural advisors, privacy counsel
- Tooling: Mozilla Common Voice forks, bespoke labeling apps, AWS-hosted storage
- Security: region-limited S3 buckets, auditable access logs, regular tikanga audits
- Pathways: internships for rangatahi, upskilling iwi staff into data governance roles

---

## Negotiating with external partners
- Declined offers from major cloud vendors lacking cultural safeguards
- Established memoranda outlining reciprocity, local hosting and revenue sharing
- Required vendors to sign tikanga training clauses and Māori IP protections
- Used staged pilots with opt-out checkpoints and independent oversight

---

## Outcomes and impact
- Delivered production-ready te reo speech-to-text with major word error rate reductions
- Provided iwi radio partners with automation for archiving oral histories
- Set precedent adopted by Te Mana Raraunga for Indigenous data licences
- Elevated Māori technologists into senior data governance leadership

---

## Takeaways for practitioners
- Embed cultural authority in every technical milestone
- Budget for roles that bridge tech and tikanga; promote to product leadership
- Use Indigenous-led licences to operationalise consent and reciprocity
- Measure success via community benefit, not just model accuracy
