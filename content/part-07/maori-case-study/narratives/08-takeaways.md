Speaker 1: So what should our learners copy from this? First, invest in cultural authority—make sure kaumātua, elders or cultural experts are leading alongside engineers. Second, treat licences as living documents that express consent and reciprocity, not just legal fine print.

Speaker 2: And build career ladders. Roles like data kaitiaki, Indigenous product managers and kaupapa-aligned cybersecurity leads should have progression into senior leadership. Success metrics need to include community benefit and language vitality, otherwise the tech will drift away from its purpose.

Speaker 1: That wraps the Te Hiku kōrero. Take a breath, capture the lessons, and then we can zoom out to mainstream open-source governance with fresh eyes—treat it as a separate toolkit you can compare and contrast, not as something that replaces the tikanga-led model we just explored.
