title: Community Governance Structures in Open Source

# Governance Journeys
*How open-source projects evolve from a single maintainer to community institutions*

---

## Solo stewardship
- Single maintainer sets the vision, triages issues and decides releases
- Fast decisions but dependent on one person's availability and boundaries
- Governance by README: contribution guide, code of conduct and release cadence documented in repo
- Risk: burnout, unreviewed security fixes, bus factor of one
- Mitigation: explicit backlog, transparent roadmaps, trusted lieutenants invited as co-maintainers

---

## Core team collectives
- 3–10 maintainers sharing rotation-based duties and voting on roadmap changes
- Lightweight decision logs in GitHub Discussions or mailing lists keep history
- Clear scopes: reviewers, release managers, community moderators
- Tools like RFC templates and "lazy consensus" speed alignment without endless meetings
- Example: Mastodon moved from single maintainer to core team with scoped working groups for moderation and infra

---

## Foundation-backed projects
- Independent legal entity provides fiscal sponsorship, trademarks and liability shields
- Boards elect technical steering committees; working groups handle docs, security, outreach
- Formal policies for membership tiers, contributor license agreements and code of conduct enforcement
- Enables long-term funding through memberships, grants and event revenue
- Examples: Linux Foundation, Apache Software Foundation, Cloud Native Computing Foundation

---

## Deciding when to formalise
- Trigger points: enterprise adoption, security-critical dependencies, or funding needs beyond donations
- Signals include growing queue of unresolved issues, corporate contributors asking for roadmaps, or maintainers lacking coverage for PTO
- Conduct community health surveys and postmortems to understand governance pain points
- Choose structure that matches capacity: fiscal sponsor vs incorporated nonprofit vs embedding in an umbrella foundation
- Document decision criteria publicly to build trust and invite feedback

---

## Roles, pathways and traits
- Roles: maintainers, release leads, community managers, foundation program officers, legal advisors
- Typical ratio: ~1 community manager per 200 active contributors in medium projects
- Entry pathways: consistent contribution streaks, outreach programs like Google Summer of Code, corporate open-source program offices
- Traits: transparent communicators, consensus-builders, patience for asynchronous debate, cultural humility when stewarding Indigenous or localised communities
- Career progression: maintainer → technical steering chair → foundation director or OSPO lead

---

## Key takeaway
Intentional governance choices let projects scale participation without losing their values.
