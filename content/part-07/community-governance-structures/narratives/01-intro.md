Speaker 1: Now that we’ve wrapped the Te Hiku kōrero, let’s switch lenses to the mainstream open-source world. Governance in open source isn’t just paperwork; it’s how communities decide who shows up, who has a vote and how funding gets spent. Most projects start with one person saying “I’ll just share this script,” then suddenly hundreds of organisations rely on it. The structures we put around that growth determine whether the maintainer burns out or builds a sustainable ecosystem.

Speaker 2: Treat this as a fresh thread, not a continuation of the Indigenous practice section. Think about governance as progressive scaffolding. You don’t pour concrete foundations for a garden shed, but you also don’t balance a skyscraper on a folding chair. For the coworking-sized projects in the middle, you need modular beams—enough structure to host dozens of teams without locking down every desk. As usage and contributions scale, the project needs sturdier guardrails, documented decision-making and support for the humans keeping the lights on.
