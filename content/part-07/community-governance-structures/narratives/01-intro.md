Speaker 1: Governance in open source isn’t just paperwork; it’s how communities decide who shows up, who has a vote and how funding gets spent. Most projects start with one person saying “I’ll just share this script,” then suddenly hundreds of organisations rely on it. The structures we put around that growth determine whether the maintainer burns out or builds a sustainable ecosystem.

Speaker 2: Think about governance as progressive scaffolding. You don’t pour concrete foundations for a garden shed, but you also don’t balance a skyscraper on a folding chair. As usage and contributions scale, the project needs sturdier guardrails, documented decision-making and support for the humans keeping the lights on.
