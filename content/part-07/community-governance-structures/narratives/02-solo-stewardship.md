Speaker 1: In the solo maintainer phase, governance is basically the maintainerâ€™s judgment plus whatever norms they capture in the README. That works because decisions are fast, but it concentrates risk. If they get sick or start a new job, issues and security patches stall. I like asking solo maintainers to publish a roadmap and contributor expectations so the community knows how to help.

Speaker 2: Another practical step is to recruit lieutenants. Give a few trusted contributors triage or release permissions, even on a trial basis. It lowers the bus factor and gives the maintainer a support network before stress turns into burnout.
