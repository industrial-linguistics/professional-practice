Speaker 1: How do you know it’s time to formalise governance? Look for pain signals: unresolved security issues piling up, companies asking for roadmaps, or maintainers cancelling holidays because no one else can cut a release. A short community health survey and retrospective can surface exactly where decisions or support structures are breaking down.

Speaker 2: From there you can choose the right scaffolding. Maybe you just need a fiscal sponsor like Open Collective Foundation to handle money, or maybe incorporating a nonprofit makes sense. The important part is to document the decision criteria and invite feedback so people understand the “why” behind the change.
