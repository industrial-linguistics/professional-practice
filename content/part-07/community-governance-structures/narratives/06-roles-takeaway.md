Speaker 1: Governance work opens up real career paths: community managers, release engineers, program officers inside foundations, even policy advisors specialising in Indigenous data sovereignty. Ratios help with planningâ€”aim for roughly one community manager per two hundred active contributors, otherwise moderation and onboarding slip.

Speaker 2: These roles suit people who can facilitate debate, document decisions and build inclusive processes across time zones. Many start with a contributor streak, a Google Summer of Code placement or a rotation through an open-source program office. Over time you might chair the technical steering committee or move into an OSPO leadership role. The takeaway is simple: intentional governance lets projects grow without sacrificing their values.
