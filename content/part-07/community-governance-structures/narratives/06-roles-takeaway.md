Speaker 1: Governance work opens up real career paths: community managers, release engineers, program officers inside foundations, even policy advisors specialising in Indigenous data sovereignty. Ratios help with planning—aim for roughly one community manager per two hundred active contributors, otherwise moderation and onboarding slip.

Speaker 2: These roles suit people who can facilitate debate, document decisions and build inclusive processes across time zones. Many start with a contributor streak, a Google Summer of Code placement or a rotation through an open-source program office. Hit that 200-contributor mark and, sure, your side project headaches multiply—but they’re the good kind that signal your impact. Over time you might chair the technical steering committee or move into an OSPO leadership role. The takeaway is simple: intentional governance lets projects grow without sacrificing their values.
