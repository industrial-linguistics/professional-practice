title: FOSS Licensing Options and Obligations
---

# FOSS Licensing Choices
*Picking the right licence for your project*

---

## Why licences matter
- Define how code can be used, shared and monetised
- Protect contributors and organisations from legal risk
- Shape community expectations and collaboration norms

---

## Permissive licences (MIT, Apache 2.0)
- Allow reuse with minimal obligations
- Require attribution and licence notice retention
- Favoured by start-ups, vendor platforms and integration partners

---

## Copyleft licences (GPL family)
- Derivative works must remain open-source
- Trigger "share alike" obligations on distribution of binaries
- Common in infrastructure maintained by foundations and public agencies

---

## Choosing for your context
- Align licence with business model, funding and compliance needs
- Consider third-party code compatibility and patent clauses
- Involve legal counsel, community tech-leads and product managers early

---

## Career pathways & responsibilities
- Roles: Open-source program office (OSPO) managers, developer advocates, legal counsels
- Entry routes: community contributions, compliance internships, dual STEM-law studies
- Growth: progress to OSPO director or head of developer relations safeguarding ecosystem health

---

## Key takeaway
Intentional licence selection balances openness, obligations and long-term sustainability.
