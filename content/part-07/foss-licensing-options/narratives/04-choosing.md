# Matching licences to organisational strategy

Selecting a licence is a cross-functional decision. Start by mapping goals: are you optimising for adoption, reciprocity, revenue or community trust? An open-source program office (OSPO) can facilitate a quick decision flow—permissive for growth flywheels, copyleft for guaranteed sharing, dual-licensing when you need both community momentum and commercial income. Keep a simple compatibility matrix handy so you avoid mixing a GPLv2 dependency with Apache 2.0 code at the eleventh hour. Projects like MySQL and Qt famously combine GPL for community users with paid commercial terms for enterprises, while MongoDB’s shift to the Server Side Public License (SSPL) shows how licence changes can protect a cloud business model.

Walk through a scenario: a government agency builds a records platform. They want vendors to contribute back fixes funded by taxpayers, so the OSPO recommends GPLv3. Legal reviews how contributions will be accepted (via Developer Certificate of Origin plus a contributor licence agreement) and comms teams set expectations with suppliers. Documenting the rationale up front prevents heated debates three years later when a new contractor joins.

The human side matters too. Choosing a licence is like drafting a roommate agreement—if you skip the tough conversations about chores (obligations) and guests (governance), you will argue when mess appears. Bring in legal counsel, community tech-leads, security engineers and product managers early, agree on international implications (governing law, data sovereignty) and schedule regular reviews as your project grows.
