# Matching licences to organisational strategy

Selecting a licence is a cross-functional decision. Open-source program office (OSPO) managers weigh how openness supports marke
t adoption, while legal counsel checks compatibility with existing commercial agreements. Security engineers assess whether the licence terms align with disclosure policies and vulnerability management workflows. Early-stage contributors often default to permissive licences for visibility, but social enterprises and civic technology teams may prefer copyleft to preserve community benefits. Document the rationale, involve stakeholders early and revisit choices as the project evolves.
