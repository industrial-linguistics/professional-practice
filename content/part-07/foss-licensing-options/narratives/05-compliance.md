# Staying compliant in practice

Maintaining compliance requires disciplined processes. Developer advocates teach engineers how to attribute dependencies within documentation and user interfaces. Build engineers automate software bill of materials (SBOM) generation to prove which licences are in use, then wire scanners into CI so incompatible combinations fail fast. Licence compliance is a bit like flossing—boring when everything seems fine, but skipping it leads to painful audits later.

Record every redistribution moment: shipping binaries, publishing container images, even offering a SaaS endpoint that incorporates AGPL code. Keep source archives ready, bundle NOTICE files and track third-party attributions in release notes. Several high-profile companies have paid settlements for overlooking these basics, so treat “we’ll fix it post-launch” as a red flag. Tools like FOSSA, OSS Review Toolkit or GitHub’s dependency review can save hours once configured.

Finally, coordinate legal artifacts. Store signed contributor licence agreements (CLAs), Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) acknowledgements and export-control assessments alongside your SBOM. That unified paper trail makes due diligence for clients, investors or acquirers straightforward—and shows professional maturity in handling open-source obligations.

## Career pathways and talent profile

Open-source program office (OSPO) analysts usually sit inside digital governance or architecture teams and represent roughly 5–10% of the broader engineering operations headcount in large enterprises. Most step into the role after five to seven years in software engineering, developer advocacy or technology law, bringing credibility with both coders and legal stakeholders. Personality-wise they need to enjoy meticulous documentation, value fairness and possess the diplomacy to resolve conflicts between community expectations and commercial pressures.

Entry pathways range from community contributors who have earned maintainer trust, to compliance interns rotating through procurement, to dual STEM-law graduates hired into tech policy teams. From there, practitioners can progress to OSPO managers coordinating licence strategy across business units, and ultimately to director or VP titles responsible for ecosystem partnerships and ethical technology commitments.
