# Staying compliant in practice

Maintaining compliance requires disciplined processes. Developer advocates teach engineers how to attribute dependencies within 
documentation and user interfaces. Build engineers automate software bill of materials (SBOM) generation to prove which licence
s are in use. Regular audits catch issues like missing source code offers for GPL components or forgotten NOTICE files for Apache libraries. Entry-level roles often start with these inventory and documentation tasks, building expertise that can lead to OSPO leadership or specialist counsel careers.
