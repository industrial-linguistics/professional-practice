# Why licensing matters for open-source

Free and open-source software (FOSS) licences translate community values into legally enforceable rules. Without them, collaborat
ion would rely on vague goodwill and expose contributors to liability. Licences are what allow organisations to adopt community-
built code with confidence, knowing the obligations they are accepting. They also give developers a say in how their work can be
used commercially, redistributed or integrated into proprietary platforms.
