# Why licensing matters for open-source

Free and open-source software (FOSS) licences translate community values into legally enforceable rules. Without them, collaboration would rely on vague goodwill and expose contributors to liability. Licences are what allow organisations to adopt community-built code with confidence, knowing the obligations they are accepting. They also give developers a say in how their work can be used commercially, redistributed or integrated into proprietary platforms.

Lack of clarity is risky. Something as small as copying an unlicensed JavaScript helper into your start-up's product can trigger a cease-and-desist or a demand to publish your whole codebase. Most licence disputes settle quietly, but the disruption, legal fees and damaged trust are real. Thinking about licensing early lets teams align technical strategy, community aspirations and compliance guardrails before launch day.

Remember: a licence is both a legal instrument and a social contract. Picking the right one signals whether you prioritise frictionless adoption, reciprocal sharing, commercial sustainability or a mix via dual-licensing. The rest of this module walks through how to make those trade-offs without losing sleepâ€”or receiving surprise letters from law firms.
