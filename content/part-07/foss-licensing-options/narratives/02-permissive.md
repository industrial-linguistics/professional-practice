# Permissive licences: flexibility with light obligations

Permissive licences such as MIT, BSD and Apache 2.0 grant broad rights to use, modify and redistribute code with few restrictio
ns. Typical conditions include preserving copyright notices and providing attribution. Apache 2.0 adds an explicit patent licenc
e and retaliation clause, which reassures enterprise adopters. Because these licences allow closed-source derivatives, they are popular with start-ups building commercial services, vendor integration teams and digital agencies that need to embed open libraries into client solutions.
