# Permissive licences: flexibility with light obligations

## What they grant and require
Permissive licences such as MIT, BSD and Apache 2.0 grant broad rights to use, modify and redistribute code with minimal restrictions. The non-negotiables are preserving copyright notices, including the licence text and avoiding liability claims against the authors. Apache 2.0 goes further by granting an explicit patent licence and a retaliation clause—if someone sues you for patent infringement over the project, they lose the right to use it. Some maintainers even publish small snippets or datasets under CC0 to effectively place them in the public domain where law allows, reducing friction for adopters.

## Why companies flock to them
Because these licences allow closed-source derivatives, they are popular with start-ups building commercial services, vendor integration teams and digital agencies embedding open libraries into client solutions. Think of React.js: Facebook chose MIT so product teams across the globe could build proprietary apps without asking permission. For early-stage ventures, the low compliance overhead and patent protection make permissive licences feel like default safe bets.

The trade-off is reciprocity. You cannot force improvements back upstream, so sustaining momentum depends on community goodwill, a healthy governance model or, in some cases, parallel commercial offerings. Tools like choosealicense.com or GitHub’s repository settings can guide first-time maintainers through the fine print before they click “public”.
