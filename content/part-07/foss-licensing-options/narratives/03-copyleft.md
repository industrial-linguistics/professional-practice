# Copyleft licences: reciprocity to sustain openness

Copyleft licences like GPLv3, LGPL and AGPL require that derivative works remain under the same licence when distributed. This “share alike” obligation is deliberate: it keeps improvements flowing back to the commons. Picture it like a viral clause—once your code touches GPL components and you ship it to customers, openness spreads to the whole bundle.

That does not mean every integration is doomed. The LGPL allows dynamic linking without relicensing your proprietary app, as long as users can relink to updated library versions. The AGPL closes the “software-as-a-service” loophole by treating network access as distribution. Android handset makers learned this the hard way: because the Linux kernel is GPLv2, device vendors must publish their modified source whenever they release a firmware image.

Copyleft rewards collaboration-heavy ecosystems such as public-sector platforms, civic tech or companies like Signal that want privacy features to remain inspectable. The key is operational discipline—track what licences flow into your builds, and brief stakeholders on when obligations trigger so surprises do not crop up the night before a launch.
