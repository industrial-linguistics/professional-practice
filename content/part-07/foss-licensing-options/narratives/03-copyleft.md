# Copyleft licences: reciprocity to sustain openness

Copyleft licences like GPLv3, LGPL and AGPL require that derivative works remain under the same licence when distributed. This "
share alike" obligation ensures improvements flow back to the community, which is why large public-sector platforms and non-pro
fit foundations often adopt copyleft terms. Teams must pay attention to how software is delivered: providing compiled binaries, offering SaaS access or linking libraries dynamically each triggers different obligations. Product managers and release engineers should keep an inventory of components to avoid accidental licence conflicts during builds.
