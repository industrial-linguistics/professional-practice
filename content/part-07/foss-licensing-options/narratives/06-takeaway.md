# Key takeaway

Thoughtful licence selection is a strategic lever. It signals how you invite collaboration, protect contributors and align with Indigenous data sovereignty commitments when projects intersect with cultural knowledge. Teams that understand obligations around reciprocity, international law, CLAs and dual-licensing can design respectful contribution models and sustain long-term trust with communities, customers and partners.
