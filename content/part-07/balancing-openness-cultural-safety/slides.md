title: Balancing Openness with Cultural Safety and Responsible Data Sharing
---

# Balancing Openness & Cultural Safety
*Sharing knowledge without giving away guardianship*

---

## The tension we manage
- Communities want visibility for their stories, research wants data, and platforms default to "public"
- Cultural safety requires respecting protocols, whakapapa and the right to say "not now"
- Openness is a spectrum: open to whom, for what purpose, and under whose authority?
- Treat each dataset as taonga first, asset second

---

## Indigenous data sovereignty principles
- CARE (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, Ethics) complements FAIR for culturally grounded projects
- OCAP® (Ownership, Control, Access, Possession) affirms First Nations governance of data lifecycles
- UNDRIP Articles 18 & 31 underpin community decision-making over cultural expressions
- Apply tikanga-led approval processes before any data leaves community servers

---

## Consent & context guardrails
- Gain informed, ongoing consent—include language about derivative uses and AI training
- Classify sensitivity tiers: open educational, community-restricted, sacred/closed
- Record provenance, cultural narratives and usage boundaries alongside technical metadata
- Plan for redaction or data synthesis where sharing could expose tapu knowledge

---

## Tiered access strategies
- Create membership-based portals with whānau-first access and layered researcher permissions
- Use data sharing agreements that require reciprocity, cultural briefings and return of insights
- Establish community review boards that can veto or amend release plans
- Schedule sunset reviews so sharing levels evolve with community comfort

---

## Governance & agreements
- Memoranda of understanding outlining kaitiaki roles, dispute resolution and benefit-sharing
- Embed cultural licences or Traditional Knowledge labels that travel with the dataset
- Require institutional partners to appoint liaison staff accountable to tribal councils
- Document escalation paths when requests breach protocol or legal boundaries

---

## Technical safeguards
- Implement attribute-based access control and audit trails for who downloads what
- Encrypt at rest and in transit, with keys held by community stewards
- Use watermarking or data usage dashboards to surface secondary sharing attempts
- Automate alerts when access patterns deviate from approved research plans

---

## Roles & team dynamics
- Roles: community tech-leads, Indigenous knowledge holders, data stewards, legal counsel, platform engineers
- Typical ratios: 1 cultural advisor per squad, 1 steward per 3–5 data partnerships
- Entry pathways: interns from iwi digital hubs, policy analysts, data analysts retrained in cultural frameworks
- Traits: relational, patient negotiators who can translate tikanga into platform features
- Progression: cultural data analyst → community tech-lead → Chief Data Steward guiding cross-organisation practice

---

## Scenario: open dataset request
- A university requests language audio for an open NLP corpus
- Community council requires a CARE-aligned impact statement and co-design workshop
- Access granted through time-bound licence, with obligations to fund digitisation and report back in te reo Māori
- Breaches trigger suspension, restorative hui and potential withdrawal of derived models

---

## Key takeaway
Openness can honour Indigenous sovereignty when cultural governance sets the terms of sharing.
