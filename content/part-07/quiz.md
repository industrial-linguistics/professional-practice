c) Replacing tikanga with FAIR principles for discoverability
d) Automating all consent decisions through AI

**Answer:** b) Prioritising collective benefit and community authority over datasets

### 7. Consent Management

a) Deleting provenance notes once data is exported
b) Tiering sensitivity levels with accompanying narratives and usage boundaries
c) Using a single Creative Commons licence for every asset

**Answer:** b) Tiering sensitivity levels with accompanying narratives and usage boundaries

### 8. Access Governance
**Question:** Which control pairs technical safeguards with tikanga-aligned governance in the cultural safety module?
a) Password rotation handled solely by vendors
b) Attribute-based access control with community-managed encryption keys and audit logs
c) Anonymous download portals to encourage contributions
d) Outsourcing monitoring to commercial data brokers

**Answer:** b) Attribute-based access control with community-managed encryption keys and audit logs

### 9. Te Hiku Media Licence
**Question:** What requirement is embedded in Te Hiku Media’s Kaitiakitanga licence?

b) Partners must demonstrate reciprocity and cultural safety before accessing language assets
c) Model outputs cannot be shared with iwi members
d) All datasets must be released into the public domain after three years

**Answer:** b) Partners must demonstrate reciprocity and cultural safety before accessing language assets

### 10. Community Tech-Lead Benchmark
**Question:** What staffing benchmark does the course provide for resourcing community tech-lead roles?
a) One tech-lead per 25 contributors
b) One tech-lead per 50 contributors
c) One tech-lead per 150–250 active contributors
d) One tech-lead per foundation board member

**Answer:** c) One tech-lead per 150–250 active contributors

## Short Answer Questions

### 11. CARE vs FAIR
**Question:** In your own words, contrast how the CARE and FAIR frameworks approach data sharing decisions.

**Sample Answer:** CARE centres community benefit, authority and responsibility, so sharing only proceeds when Indigenous governance approves the purpose and safeguards. FAIR focuses on making datasets findable and reusable, which can be helpful technically but risks ignoring cultural consent if used alone.

### 12. Solo Maintainer Risk
**Question:** Describe one step a solo maintainer can take to reduce burnout risk before formal governance structures exist.

**Sample Answer:** They can delegate triage or release permissions to trusted contributors who consistently follow guidelines, lowering the bus factor and building a support network ahead of crises.

### 13. Cultural Access Agreements
**Question:** What should memoranda of understanding include to uphold Indigenous data sovereignty when collaborating with external researchers?

**Sample Answer:** Agreements should define kaitiaki roles, dispute resolution, benefit-sharing expectations, cultural safety training requirements and conditions for suspending access if protocols are breached.

## Scenario-Based Questions

### 14. Licensing Strategy Scenario
**Question:** A government agency wants vendors to contribute improvements back to a citizen-facing platform funded by taxpayers. Based on the licensing lessons, what licence approach and supporting processes should the agency adopt?

**Sample Answer:** Choose a copyleft licence such as GPLv3 to require redistributed derivatives to remain open, pair it with clear contributor agreements (DCO or CLA), and brief contractors on when obligations trigger so they plan compliance before deployment.

### 15. Data Access Scenario
**Question:** A university lab requests access to an iwi audio archive to train speech recognition models. Outline the due diligence steps the community tech-lead should require before approving the request.

**Sample Answer:** Ask the lab to provide a CARE-aligned impact statement, attend cultural safety briefings, agree to tiered access conditions, ensure storage remains under community-controlled keys, and commit to reporting back outcomes in te reo Māori with restorative processes for any breaches.
