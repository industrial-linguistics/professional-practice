# Service Performance Monitoring
*Staying proactive after go-live*

---

## Why watch metrics beyond renewals?

Even after the ink dries on a contract, you need visibility into how well the vendor performs day to day. Service quality can drift over time as priorities change or teams turn over. Monitoring keeps small problems from becoming chronic frustrations. For instance, a help desk might respond quickly during onboarding but grow slower once the vendor has your business locked in. Tracking trends shows whether promised service levels still hold true a year later. Ultimately, performance monitoring gives you data to negotiate improvements rather than relying on vague impressions.

## Service quality KPIs

- Response and resolution times for support tickets
- Percentage of uptime and outage duration
- Accuracy of change or release deployments
- Customer satisfaction surveys and Net Promoter Scores
- Adoption or usage rates for key features

## Turning insights into actions

Collecting KPIs is just the start. Regularly review the numbers with your vendor and agree on improvement plans. Maybe recurring outages show the need for extra capacity, or survey feedback suggests better documentation. Document the action items, assign owners and follow up next review. An ongoing feedback loop turns raw metrics into tangible service upgrades and helps justify renewal decisions.

## Key takeaway

- Track KPIs continuously, not just at renewal time
- Review results jointly and set improvement targets
- Use data trends to drive conversations on service quality
