Speaker 1: Think about picking a phone plan or internet provider. Every vendor promises fast service and low costs, but only some actually pick up the phone when you need help.
Speaker 2: Exactly. Choosing a vendor is a lot like datingâ€”the glossy profile looks great, but you need to see how they handle stress and whether they keep their promises.
Speaker 1: A structured approach helps you avoid expensive surprises later. A poor choice can lead to downtime, lost data, or endless finger-pointing when things break.
Speaker 2: So vendor evaluation isn't busywork. It's the foundation for partnerships you can rely on when the unexpected strikes.
