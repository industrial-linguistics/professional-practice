Speaker 1: Start with the hard facts like technical compatibility, capacity to scale, and a solid security posture.
Speaker 2: Asking about security is like asking if someone is a good driverâ€”everyone says yes, so check their track record of audits and breaches.
Speaker 1: Consider financial stability too. Remember Borders Bookstore? When they shut down, many niche vendors lost a major client overnight.
Speaker 2: Cultural fit also matters. A startup vendor might move fast and break things, while a large enterprise expects lengthy approvals. Choose the rhythm that matches your own team.
Speaker 1: Finally, look for transparent communication and clear roadmaps so you aren't surprised by hidden fees or sudden changes.
