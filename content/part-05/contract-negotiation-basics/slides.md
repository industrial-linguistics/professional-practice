# Contract Negotiation Basics
*Setting terms that protect everyone*

---

## Why negotiate carefully
- Locking in fair SLA commitments avoids later disputes
- Pricing models affect long term cost and vendor leverage
- Exit clauses let you switch providers without chaos

---

## Typical SLA terms
- Uptime or response time guarantees
- Support hours and escalation paths
- Penalties or service credits for breaches
- Data protection and compliance requirements

---

## Pricing models
- Fixed price vs usage based billing
- Tiered discounts for volume or commitment
- Renewal increases and indexation clauses
- Hidden costs: onboarding, add-ons or overage fees

---

## Exit and renewal options
- Notice periods and handover assistance
- Data portability provisions
- Rights to extend or renegotiate terms
- Avoiding vendor lock-in through clear off ramps

---

## Key takeaway
Clear contracts with realistic SLAs and flexible exits build healthy vendor relationships.
