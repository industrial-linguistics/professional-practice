# Contract Negotiation Basics
*Setting terms that protect everyone*

---

## Why negotiate carefully
Speaker 1: So why bother going back and forth with a vendor instead of just signing their standard agreement?
Speaker 2: Because those "standard terms" rarely protect you when something goes wrong. Imagine your payment processor dropping out on Black Friday.
Speaker 1: If you haven't locked in clear uptime commitments, you end up eating the loss while they shrug and say it's "industry standard."
Speaker 2: Exactly. Negotiating ahead of time defines how quickly they respond and what compensation you get if they fail. It also clarifies pricing so you don't face huge renewal hikes.
Speaker 1: And we want an exit clause so we can switch providers if service tanks or costs skyrocket.
Speaker 2: Right. A contract sets expectations for the entire relationship, so investing time upfront saves endless headaches later.

## Typical SLA terms
Speaker 1: SLAs might look like a list of numbers, but they shape daily operations.
Speaker 2: 99.9% uptime sounds great until you realize that's about 8.7 hours of downtime per year—a full business day lost.
Speaker 1: Make sure the contract spells out how you'll be notified when outages happen and who escalates issues. Without that clarity, you might spend hours chasing support.
Speaker 2: Also check for penalties or service credits. If they breach the SLA, you want more than a "sorry" email.
Speaker 1: Data protection requirements matter too. If the vendor handles customer data, they must meet your compliance standards or you'll be the one explaining a breach.

## Pricing models
Speaker 1: Pricing can be tricky. Some vendors push fixed monthly fees, while others charge per user or per gigabyte.
Speaker 2: The pay-per-use model sounds cheap at first, but if your usage spikes, your budget does too. Remember the first AWS invoice that shocked half the startups?
Speaker 1: A traditional hosting contract might cost $2,000 a month with predictable limits. That same workload on a usage-based platform could be $500 in quiet months but $5,000 when traffic surges.
Speaker 2: Ask about tiered discounts and how renewals are calculated. A 5% increase each year adds up fast.
Speaker 1: And watch for onboarding fees and the "essential" add-ons that suddenly appear after you sign.
Speaker 2: It's like buying a cheap printer and then realizing the ink cartridges cost a fortune. Build a model that shows worst-case costs before you commit.

## Exit and renewal options
Speaker 1: Contracts often bury the exit clause in fine print, but it's crucial.
Speaker 2: I've seen a company stuck with a failing vendor for six months because they needed 180 days notice just to terminate.
Speaker 1: When vendor X went bankrupt, Company Y lost three months of data because no one negotiated a clean handover.
Speaker 2: A solid contract should specify data portability—how you'll get your info back—and how long the vendor must keep supporting you during the transition.
Speaker 1: Renewal terms matter too. If there's an automatic price hike after year one, you need time to renegotiate or switch before it kicks in.
Speaker 2: Treat the exit clause like a fire escape plan. You hope you never use it, but you'll be glad it's there if the building catches fire.

## Risk assessment frameworks
Speaker 1: Before signing, run a risk assessment so you know what you're getting into.
Speaker 2: Think of it like checking the weather before a hike—you'd want to know if a storm is coming.
Speaker 1: Start with basic financial stability and market position. A vendor that's losing money might cut corners on support.
Speaker 2: Then dig into security posture. Ask about their last penetration test and how quickly they patch vulnerabilities.
Speaker 1: Frameworks like NIST's vendor risk assessment or SIG questionnaires give you a consistent checklist.
Speaker 2: They also force the vendor to show evidence instead of just saying, "Trust us, we're secure." Score each area—finance, security, support history—and only move forward if they meet your risk threshold.

## Regulatory and legal considerations
Speaker 1: When should you bring lawyers into the conversation?
Speaker 2: Early, especially if you're in a regulated industry like healthcare or finance.
Speaker 1: A HIPAA violation can carry hefty fines and reputation damage if patient data isn't handled correctly.
Speaker 2: Financial services have PCI-DSS and SOX rules that require extra controls. The contract needs to call out who is responsible for compliance.
Speaker 1: International deals add another layer. Data sovereignty laws might restrict where information is stored or processed.
Speaker 2: That's why many companies require vendors to keep data within certain regions or sign data processing agreements.
Speaker 1: Legal review also clarifies intellectual property rights and liability caps so you don't end up footing the bill for mistakes you didn't make.

## Vendor evaluation checklist
Speaker 1: Let's break down a quick checklist before you sign anything.
Speaker 2: Start with references. Talk to current customers and ask what went wrong as well as what went right.
Speaker 1: Review their security certifications, like ISO 27001 or SOC 2, and confirm they're up to date.
Speaker 2: Check financial statements, or at least credit ratings, to see if the company will still be around next year.
Speaker 1: Then evaluate support responsiveness—try calling their help line before you sign to see how quickly they answer.
Speaker 2: Finally, map each requirement in your RFP to contract language so nothing gets lost between sales promises and the final document.

## Red flags and hidden costs
Speaker 1: What warning signs should make you think twice about a contract?
Speaker 2: Beware of vague promises like "industry standard pricing" with no actual numbers attached. That usually means "expensive but everyone charges it."
Speaker 1: Another red flag is heavy reliance on proprietary tools without clear integration paths. If you can't move your data easily, you're locked in.
Speaker 2: Watch out for discounts that disappear after the first year or fees for "mandatory" training. One vendor quoted $50 per user per month but then required a $2,000 setup course.
Speaker 1: Make sure support levels match what sales promised. If the contract downgrades response times, push back.
Speaker 2: Lastly, check for unilateral change clauses. If they can update terms whenever they want, your carefully negotiated deal won't last.

## Post-contract relationship management
Speaker 1: Negotiations don't end once the ink dries.
Speaker 2: Contracts should include regular service reviews so you're not surprised by declining quality.
Speaker 1: Schedule quarterly check-ins to go over performance metrics and any pending changes to the product or pricing.
Speaker 2: If you treat it like a partnership rather than a one-off transaction, you're more likely to catch issues before they become crises.
Speaker 1: And if the vendor consistently meets or exceeds the SLA, you can use that data to justify renewals or expanded services.
Speaker 2: Conversely, if things start slipping, the contract should outline escalation steps so you can course-correct—or start planning that exit clause.

## Key takeaway
Speaker 1: Negotiating a contract is about more than haggling over price.
Speaker 2: A well-structured agreement protects you against downtime, hidden costs, and unforeseen changes.
Speaker 1: It takes work—checklists, risk frameworks, and sometimes legal advice—but the payoff is stability and predictability.
Speaker 2: When you define clear SLAs, build in fair pricing models, and plan a safe exit strategy, you create partnerships that strengthen the business instead of draining it.
Speaker 1: Keep reviewing the contract as your needs evolve, and don't be afraid to renegotiate when circumstances change.
Speaker 2: Good contracts grow with you, turning vendors into true long-term allies. It's tempting to rush through negotiations when budgets are tight or timelines are short. Resist that pressure—the extra time you spend hammering out details now can save months of frustration later.
