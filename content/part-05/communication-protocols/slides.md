title: Vendor Communication Protocols

# Communication Protocols
*Keeping vendors in sync*

---

## Why establish protocols?

Regular communication prevents misunderstandings and surfaces issues early. Clear expectations reduce friction when priorities shift or problems arise. Setting protocols upfront tells everyone who to contact and when. Without structure, updates happen randomly and serious concerns may get buried. Simple guidelines—like who runs meetings and how often reports are shared—keep the relationship healthy and ensure both sides know what success looks like.

---

## Regular check-ins

- Schedule weekly or monthly calls depending on service criticality
- Share agendas beforehand and track action items
- Use these sessions to review metrics, roadmap changes and upcoming risks

---

## Escalation paths

- Define primary contacts and backups at both companies
- Document severity levels and response times
- Provide a direct line to management for urgent issues

---

## Reporting cadence

- Monthly performance summaries and quarterly strategy reviews
- Incident reports within 24 hours of outages
- Periodic satisfaction surveys to adjust course

---

## Key takeaway

Consistent communication builds trust and keeps projects on track.
