# Customer Success Teams
*where "set it and forget it" goes to die*

---

## Why customer success matters
- **Post-deployment value delivery**: 73% of software purchases fail to deliver expected ROI without a CS team guiding adoption
- **Churn prevention**: Proactive engagement cuts churn by 67% compared with reactive support models
- **Voice of customer**: Success managers feed real usage data back to product and engineering to shape roadmaps

**Example**: Zoom once saw an enterprise client ignore video features. Their CS manager discovered shaky network links were the culprit, looped in infrastructure teams, and adoption jumped from 30% to 85% in a quarter.

---

## Driving adoption
- **Onboarding playbooks** outline training sessions, champion networks, and milestones so users aren't left staring at blank logins
- **Health checks** review login frequency, feature usage, and ticket volumes to spot stalled deployments early
- **Best-practice libraries** and success plans act like personal trainers—buying the gym membership isn't enough without a workout schedule

**Example**: Slack's CS crew coached Acme Corp through weekly workshops and workflow templates, taking team adoption from 20% to 80% in six months.

---

## Collaboration & health metrics
- **Cross-functional partnerships** with sales, product, and support keep everyone aligned on customer outcomes
- **Health scores** mix login frequency, feature depth, and support ticket trends; "How are you feeling?" doesn't scale to 10,000 accounts
- **Early warnings**: Red scores trigger escalation paths before renewal time turns into a crisis

**Example**: A drop in Net Promoter Score at HubSpot prompted CS to partner with support and ship tutorials, restoring scores within one cycle.

---

## Expansion and renewals
- **Upsell and cross-sell** opportunities surface when CS maps product usage to business goals and uncovers new pains
- **Renewal timelines** are tracked months in advance with risk flags and stakeholder maps
- **Churn prediction** models weigh executive sponsorship, adoption metrics, and sentiment to prioritise outreach

**Example**: Gainsight flagged a "yellow" health score for a SaaS client; the CS manager offered workflow automation modules that lifted value perception and closed a 30% expansion before the renewal date.

---

## Customer success tools
- **Gainsight and ChurnZero** aggregate usage analytics, playbook tasks, and renewal dashboards that a CSM checks first thing Monday
- **Salesforce and HubSpot** host success plans and document the handoff from sales to post-sales teams
- **Specialised add-ons** like Zendesk or Intercom surface support signals directly in the success console

**Example**: A CSM logs into ChurnZero, sees declining API calls for a fintech client, and launches an automated "need help integrating?" campaign before frustration hits Slack.

---

## Handoff & playbooks
- **Sales to CS**: Deals arrive with documented business goals, admin contacts, and promised features—no "surprise" requirements
- **CS to support**: Escalation runbooks and RACI charts clarify who tackles technical hiccups vs adoption coaching
- **Onboarding playbooks** spell out week-by-week tasks, from kickoff calls to data import dry runs

**Example**: After closing a ServiceNow deal, the rep schedules a three-way kickoff with CS and support, sharing an onboarding checklist that keeps everyone rowing in the same direction.

---

## Careers in customer success
- **Roles** range from Customer Success Manager and Technical Success Manager to data-savvy CS Analyst
- **Entry pathways** often start in account management, support, or consulting; strong communicators with curiosity thrive
- **Salary ranges**: entry-level roles around USD $70k, seasoned managers $100k–$150k, with director paths beyond
- **Skills** blend relationship building, light project management, and enough technical aptitude to translate logs into plain English

**Example**: A former support engineer moves into a Technical Success role, leverages API know-how, and progresses to managing strategic accounts within two years.

---

## Key takeaway
Customer success turns one-time sales into long-term partnerships by coaching adoption, decoding health metrics, and coordinating handoffs across sales, product, and support. With the right tools and playbooks, CS teams surface growth opportunities before renewal dates sneak up. For tech professionals, the field offers hybrid careers that reward empathy, analytical thinking, and an appetite for helping customers win long after go-live.
