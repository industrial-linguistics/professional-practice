Speaker 1: This sounds like a different breed of IT job. What career options exist in customer success?
Speaker 2: Plenty. You have CSMs managing accounts, Technical Success Managers helping with APIs, and analysts crunching usage data.
Speaker 1: Where do these folks come from?
Speaker 2: Many start in support or account management and pivot. Relationship builders with some technical curiosity do well.
Speaker 1: What about pay and growth?
Speaker 2: Entry roles hover around seventy grand, senior managers can hit six figures, and directors lead large teams with strategic sway.
Speaker 1: So it's a path for people who like both tech and people.
Speaker 2: Exactly, a hybrid career where empathy meets analytics.
