Speaker 1: How do deals move from sales to customer success without dropping details?
Speaker 2: Ideally there's a formal handoff meeting. Sales shares the promised outcomes, key contacts, and any skeletons in the closet.
Speaker 1: Then CS runs with it?
Speaker 2: With support close by. They agree on who tackles technical issues versus adoption coaching, often using a RACI chart.
Speaker 1: So no one argues later about "I thought you were doing that."
Speaker 2: Exactly. A clear playbook means the customer feels a single smooth journey instead of a baton dropped between teams.
