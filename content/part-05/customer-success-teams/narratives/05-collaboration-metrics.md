Speaker 1: All that tracking must take a lot of cooperation across teams.
Speaker 2: It does. CS shares usage trends with product, flags billing risks for sales, and pings support when tickets spike.
Speaker 1: And those "health scores" everyone talks aboutâ€”what's actually in them?
Speaker 2: Usually logins, feature depth, survey results, even how many tickets a client raises. It's a bit like checking pulse, blood pressure, and mood in one snapshot.
Speaker 1: Handy, because asking "How are you feeling?" doesn't scale to thousands of customers.
Speaker 2: Exactly, and when a score dips, there's a playbook ready before renewal panic sets in.
