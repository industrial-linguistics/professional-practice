## Key Topics

- Vendor evaluation criteria and selection processes.

## Job Roles Focus

This part highlights both client and vendor-side careers:

- **Sales Development Representative (SDR)** and **Account Executive** – prospecting, qualifying and closing deals.
- **Solutions Engineer** – providing technical presales support and demonstrations.
- **Customer Success Manager (CSM)** – driving adoption, renewals and customer health checks.
- **Service Delivery Manager** – coordinating ongoing operations between vendor and client teams.

A capstone exercise will walk through a Microsoft 365 migration scenario, mapping vendor promises to ITIL workflows and calculating ROI when SLAs improve.
