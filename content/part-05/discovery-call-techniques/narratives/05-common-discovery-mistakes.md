Speaker 1: The easiest way to tank a discovery call is to talk more than the prospect. I once filled ten minutes explaining our stack and realized they hadn't said a word beyond "hello."
Speaker 2: Pitching too early is another trap. If you demo backup software before they admit their last ransomware scare, you're solving a problem they haven't owned yet.
Speaker 1: The third mistake is skipping follow-up questions. When a client mentions their cloud migration is "messy," don't nod and move on. Ask, "Messy how?" You might uncover a remote office still running a closet server under someone's desk.
Speaker 2: Avoid these pitfalls and the call feels like a consult, not a commercial. You learn where they're bleeding time or money, and they feel heard instead of sold to.
