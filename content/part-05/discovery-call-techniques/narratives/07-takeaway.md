Speaker 1: Discovery isn't about having the perfect pitch. It's about being curious enough to uncover pains worth solving and proving you can help.
Speaker 2: When you ask thoughtful questions, listen for what's unsaid, and dodge the common mistakes, prospects start sharing the messy stuffâ€”like the remote office still on Windows 7 or the compliance audit that keeps them up at night.
Speaker 1: Wrap each call by recapping what you heard and the next step you both agreed on. That simple follow-up note shows respect for their time and keeps the momentum going.
Speaker 2: Do that consistently and discovery calls stop feeling like cold outreach. They become the start of real partnerships that solve real problems.
