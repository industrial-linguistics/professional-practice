# Discovery Call Techniques
*Surfacing real customer pain*

---

## Set the stage
- Research prospect and context – LinkedIn stalking, but make it professional
- Open with agenda and outcome
- Use open-ended warm-up questions

---

## Probe for pain points
- Ask what's slowing them down today
- Explore current workaround or cost (server downtime, audit panic)
- Let silence work – embrace the awkward pause

---

## Listen and dig deeper
- Paraphrase to confirm understanding
- Ask "what happens if it stays this way?" – you'll keep having these calls forever
- Note emotional cues and urgency (breach aftermath, remote-work headaches)

---

## Common discovery mistakes
- Talking too much
- Pitching too early
- Not asking follow-up questions

---

## Qualify and guide next steps
- Check timeline, budget and authority
- Link pain to potential value quickly
- Schedule follow-up while energy is high

---

Curious, patient questions uncover the real problems you can solve.
