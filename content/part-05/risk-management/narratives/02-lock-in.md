Speaker 1: "Vendor lock-in" means it's painfully difficult to move your data or
workflow somewhere else. Think about a car that only runs on fuel from one
specific gas station chain.
Speaker 2: The longer you rely on their proprietary format, the more trapped you
become. I've seen companies spend six months and $50,000 just to migrate their
customer databases to a new CRM.
Speaker 1: That's why you negotiate export capabilities and reasonable notice
periods up front. Ask to see an export demo during the sales process, not after
you've signed a contract.
Speaker 2: When switching is possible before you need to switch, you keep the
power in the relationship instead of the vendor.
