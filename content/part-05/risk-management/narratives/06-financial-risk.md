Speaker 1: Hidden costs are often the biggest surprise with a new vendor.
Speaker 2: So what should we look out for in pricing structures? Licensing tiers, data overage charges and currency swings can blow the budget fast.
Speaker 1: I've seen startups lure customers with low introductory pricing, then double rates after a year when you're deeply integrated. Per-seat licensing that seems cheap at ten users may balloon to fifty thousand dollars at five hundred.
Speaker 2: That's why you model best- and worst-case scenarios before signing. Ask how renewals are calculated and whether discounts vanish if usage dips.
Speaker 1: A solid financial assessment now prevents nasty surprises later and helps you decide whether a cheaper vendor actually costs more in the long run.
