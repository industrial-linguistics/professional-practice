# Cost Optimisation Strategies
*Getting the most from vendor spend*

## Why cost management matters

Unwatched subscriptions and idle cloud resources quietly drain budgets. Like gym memberships, software licences are easy to buy and surprisingly hard to cancel. Industry surveys show 10–20% of IT spend goes to tools nobody uses. Definitions help: “shelfware” is software bought but never used, and “over‑provisioning” is paying for more capacity than required. By reviewing spend quarterly, finance, procurement and IT ops keep the budget aligned with actual value and avoid nasty surprises at renewal time.

## Usage analysis

Start with the basics: how many licences did you pay for and how many people actually logged in? If you have 100 Office 365 seats but only 60 active users, that’s forty potential cancellations. Pull cloud consumption reports to spot over‑provisioned virtual machines or forgotten storage. A simple spreadsheet with columns for cost, owner and last login date can reveal shelfware instantly. Those numbers become your negotiation superpower—without data you’re guessing, with data you control the conversation.

## Common cost traps

Many budgets leak through small oversights. Auto‑escalating pricing clauses quietly raise rates each year. Per‑user pricing, when only a fraction of accounts are active, wastes money. Teams often juggle Slack, Teams and Discord simultaneously or leave development environments running 24/7. Each issue seems minor until multiplied across months. A friendly quarterly audit with a checklist for these traps keeps them from snowballing and frees cash for strategic projects instead of needless subscriptions.

## Renegotiation timing

Vendors love auto‑renewals because they lock in last year’s price without questions. Set calendar reminders ninety days before each contract anniversary so you steer the discussion. Bring concrete examples such as “Our usage dropped 30% since remote work ended, so we’d like to downgrade from Enterprise to Standard tier.” Ask about discount levels, bundle options and payment per active user. Negotiations become a normal business conversation when backed by usage data rather than a desperate plea at the last minute.

---

## Tactics and frameworks

A repeatable playbook prevents surprises. Use a quarterly review checklist covering licence counts, usage trends, upcoming renewals and overlapping tools. Template negotiation questions include: “What discount tiers exist?”, “Can we commit longer for better rates?” and “Do you offer per‑active‑user pricing?” For a quick ROI check, divide the cost of a tool by the hours saved and multiply by the hourly rate. Cloud bills fall when batch jobs run in off‑peak hours and when you buy “reserved instances”—prepaid capacity cheaper than on‑demand.

## Practical exercise: case study

Consider a startup paying for Slack, Teams and Discord while half its test servers run all weekend. Estimate the wasted monthly cost, then draft two actions to fix it. Could consolidating to a single chat platform save a thousand dollars a month? Would a simple script shutting down test machines at night halve the cloud bill? Use this scenario to practise reading usage reports, calculating savings and deciding which teams—IT ops, finance or procurement—you’d pull into the conversation.

## Careers in cost optimisation

Cost control isn’t just a finance chore. **Procurement analysts** negotiate terms, **IT operations** monitor usage and **FinOps specialists** blend technical and financial skills to tame cloud bills. Entry‑level analysts might start with licence audits or data cleanup and progress into vendor manager or IT finance roles. Core skills include spreadsheet fluency, curiosity about how services work and the confidence to challenge pricing. The demand for people who can translate between tech and money continues to grow.

---

## Key takeaway

Optimising vendor spend is an ongoing process, not a one‑off audit. Regular reviews, awareness of common traps and a clear negotiation playbook keep budgets lean without harming service quality. Approach cost data with a bit of humour—you might find you’re paying for 500 seats when half your team still thinks “the cloud” is just weather. The savings you uncover can fund innovation rather than waste, turning cost control into a strategic advantage.
