# Cost Optimisation Strategies
*Getting the most from vendor spend*

---

## Why cost management matters

Unwatched subscriptions and capacity over-provisioning quietly drain budgets. Vendors rarely lower prices unless you ask. A deliberate approach keeps spend aligned with value and frees money for higher priorities.

---

## Usage analysis

- Review licence counts and service consumption regularly
- Spot idle resources or duplicated tools
- Benchmark costs against usage trends and forecasts

---

## Renegotiation timing

- Calendar contract anniversaries well before auto-renewal
- Use usage data to justify discounts or tier changes
- Bundle services or commit longer for better pricing

---

## Additional tactics

- Consolidate overlapping vendors to gain volume leverage
- Rightsize service tiers and remove unused accounts
- Schedule off-peak or reserved capacity where supported

---

## Key takeaway

Continuous analysis and timely renegotiations prevent vendor creep and stretch budgets further.
