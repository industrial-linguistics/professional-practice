Speaker 1: Let's practise with a simple case.
Speaker 2: Imagine a startup paying for Slack, Teams and Discord while half its test servers run all weekend.
Speaker 1: Estimate how much is wasted each month: maybe a thousand dollars on chat apps and another thousand on idle compute.
Speaker 2: Could consolidating tools or scheduling nightly shutdown scripts recapture that spend?
Speaker 1: Write down two actions you'd take and which teams you'd involveâ€”IT ops for automation, finance for the numbers, procurement for contract changes.
Speaker 2: Exercises like this build the muscle of spotting waste and rallying the right people to fix it before budgets get cut.
