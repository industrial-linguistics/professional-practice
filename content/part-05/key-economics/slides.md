# Key Economics in Tech Sales
*ARR vs one-time deals and land-and-expand growth*

---

## ARR vs one-time deals
- ARR: subscription revenue recognised annually
- One-time deals: perpetual licence or project fees
- Investors favour recurring revenue streams

---

## Benefits of ARR
Predictable cash flow, easier forecasting, and higher company valuations. ARR contracts encourage ongoing customer engagement and allow sales teams to focus on renewals and expansion rather than chasing fresh one-off deals each quarter.

---

## When one-time deals make sense
Hardware purchases or consulting engagements may still use up-front billing. They can deliver quick cash but lack stickiness; revenue resets to zero unless new deals close. They also complicate year-over-year comparisons.

---

## Land-and-expand strategy
Start with a small beachhead contract, prove value, then add seats, features or new divisions. Success relies on customer success teams to nurture accounts and spot expansion triggers.

---

## Metrics to watch
- ARR / MRR and annual contract value
- Gross retention vs net retention
- Expansion revenue from cross-sell and upsell
- Payback period on customer acquisition cost

---

## Practical exercise: revenue mix
Analyse a sample company with 500k ARR and 200k in one-time services. Estimate the impact if 20% of one-time work converted to subscriptions and model the new ARR.

---

## Careers in revenue economics
Roles include **revenue operations analysts**, **sales finance partners** and **customer success managers**. Entry roles start with CRM hygiene and deal desk support, growing into strategic pricing or go-to-market leadership.

---

## Key takeaway
Understanding how ARR, one-time deals and land-and-expand motion shape cash flow helps align sales tactics with long-term growth.
