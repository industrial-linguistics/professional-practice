# Key Economics in Tech Sales
*ARR vs one-time deals and land-and-expand growth*

---

## ARR vs one-time deals
Annual recurring revenue acts like a subscriptionâ€”think Netflix but for business tools. It smooths contracted income into a predictable stream, so Salesforce can tout more than $30B in ARR while a consulting firm chases project spikes. One-time deals land big cheques but reset the counter every quarter and muddy forecasts.

---

## Benefits of ARR
Predictable cash flow, easier forecasting, and higher company valuations. ARR contracts encourage ongoing customer engagement and allow sales teams to focus on renewals and expansion rather than chasing fresh one-off deals each quarter.

---

## When one-time deals make sense
Hardware purchases or consulting engagements may still use up-front billing. They can deliver quick cash but lack stickiness; revenue resets to zero unless new deals close. They also complicate year-over-year comparisons.

---

## Pricing models
- Per-seat licences scale with headcount but can cap expansion.
- Usage-based fees map cost to consumption, common for fintech APIs.
- Tiered feature bundles let customers graduate as needs grow.
- The pricing mix shapes upsell paths and revenue predictability.

---

## Contract structures
- Annual terms give frequent renewal checkpoints.
- Multi-year deals lock in revenue but may require discounts.
- Up-front prepay boosts cash flow; quarterly payments ease budgets.
- Auto-renew clauses and payment terms influence churn risk.

---

## Land-and-expand strategy
Start with a small beachhead contract, prove value, then add seats, features or new divisions. Success relies on customer success teams to nurture accounts and spot expansion triggers.

---

## Metrics to watch
- ARR and MRR show the recurring base; **ACV** measures a contract's annual value.
- Gross retention under 90% signals churn problems; net retention over 100% shows healthy expansion.
- Track customer lifetime value, LTV:CAC ratios and expansion revenue from cross-sell or upsell.
- Payback period asks how many months before acquisition cost is recovered.

## Practical exercise: revenue mix
A sample company has $500k ARR and $200k in one-time services. If 20% of services shift to subscriptions, add $40k to ARR for a new total of $540k while services drop to $160k. Recalculate the revenue mix and discuss how recurring dollars might change valuation and hiring plans.

---

## Careers in revenue economics
Roles include **revenue operations analysts**, **sales finance partners** and **customer success managers**. Entry roles start with CRM hygiene and deal desk support, growing into strategic pricing or go-to-market leadership.

---

## Key takeaway
Understanding how ARR, one-time deals and land-and-expand motion shape cash flow helps align sales tactics with long-term growth.
