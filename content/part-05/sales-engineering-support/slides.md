# Sales Engineering Support
*Turning ideas into workable solutions*

---

## Demo environments
- Build realistic sandboxes with sanitized customer-style data
- Script scenarios from discovery calls for believable workflows
- Maintain snapshots so resets take minutes
- Because nobody wants to see "Lorem ipsum" in a mission-critical dashboard

---

## Proof of concept vs demo
- Demos show; POCs prove integration under real conditions
- Time-box POCs with clear success criteria
- Run POCs when stakes are high or workflows are unique
- Celebrate when the test data finally flows

---

## RFP responses
- Address sections like technical requirements, security compliance, integration timelines
- Translate "Can it do X?" into qualified answers with diagrams and caveats
- Coordinate with product, security, and legal teams
- Highlight differentiators without promising unicorns

---

## Handling technical objections
- Prepare FAQ and architecture sketches for common blockers
- Use whiteboards or diagramming tools to explain designs
- Admit limitations and offer workarounds
- When someone says "It should just work," brew more coffee

---

## Integration planning
- Send discovery questionnaires and run technical interviews
- Map SSO, API, and data migration paths early
- Assess dependencies and risk before contracts are signed
- Provide blueprints that prevent scope creep later

---

## Post-sale handoff
- Share demo and POC context with implementation teams
- Schedule kickoff meetings and knowledge transfer sessions
- Document decisions so "what was promised" stays clear

---

## Tools of the trade
- Sandbox environments, feature flags, and data generators
- Diagramming tools like Lucidchart or Visio
- Collaboration suites and ticketing systems
- Caffeine in many forms

---

## Career snapshot
- Entry paths: internships, support roles, or curious developers
- Skills: technical breadth, communication, and improvisation
- Typical day: discovery calls, lab tinkering, and demos
- Growth: product management, solutions architecture, or team leadership

---

## Key takeaway
Sales engineers bridge vision and delivery by proving capability, shaping proposals, handling objections, and preparing implementation paths.
