title: Challenger Sales Mindset with BANT and MEDDIC
---

# Challenger Sales Mindset
*Qualifying leads through insight*

---

## Challenger approach
- Teach customers a new perspective
- Tailor the message to their priorities
- Take control of the conversation and next steps
- Reframe with data (self-service portal cuts tickets by 30%)
- It's like being a consultant who actually knows what they're talking about

---

## BANT qualification basics
- Budget available and defined ("We have $50K" but funds arrive next year)
- Authority to approve the purchase — talking to someone's nephew who 'handles the computers' won't close deals
- Need clearly articulated — ask what happens if it waits a quarter
- Timeline for decision and rollout

---

## MEDDIC framework
- Metrics that define success
- Economic buyer who holds the funds (engineer ≠ CIO)
- Decision criteria and process
- Identify pain points and a champion
- MEDDIC sounds like a prescription drug, but it won't cure your sales hangover

---

## Using frameworks together
- Start with insight to reframe the problem
- Qualify opportunities with BANT or MEDDIC
- Map findings to your value proposition
- Works in IT and beyond to focus energy on real deals

---

## Key takeaway
Leading with insight and structured qualification drives consistent deal success.
Next step: map one current lead using BANT and MEDDIC.
