# Usage-Based Pricing & Churn Prevention
*Aligning revenue with customer value*

---

## What is usage-based pricing?
Charges scale with consumption rather than fixed licences.
It lowers initial commitment and grows as usage climbs.

---

## Common usage metrics
- API calls or transactions
- Data volume processed
- Seats activated per month
- Compute or storage hours

---

## Benefits
- Fair mapping of cost to value
- Easier entry for small customers
- Expansion built into adoption

---

## Pitfalls to watch
- Revenue becomes harder to forecast
- Spiky bills can shock customers
- Requires solid telemetry and billing

---

## Churn prevention basics
Monitor adoption and support signals
before customers quietly disengage.

---

## Customer health scoring
Combine product usage, support tickets,
NPS and contract age into a single score.

---

## Acting on health scores
Target low-scoring accounts with
enablement or incentives before renewal.

---

## Key takeaway
Usage-based pricing ties price to value, and
health scoring catches churn before it bites.
