# Usage-Based Pricing & Churn Prevention
*Aligning revenue with customer value*

---

## What is usage-based pricing?
Charges scale with consumption rather than fixed licences.
Like paying for electricity or Netflix hours, not annual seats.
Lower initial commitment and grows as usage climbs.

---

## Common usage metrics
- API calls or transactions (e.g., $0.01 per call)
- Data stored or transferred ($0.023/GB on S3)
- Seats activated per month
- Compute or storage hours

---

## Hybrid pricing models
- Base fee plus metered add-ons
- Smooths cash flow while keeping upside
- Example: reserved capacity + burst pricing

---

## Benefits
- Fair mapping of cost to value
- Easier entry for small customers
- Expansion built into adoption
- Aligns expenses with cloud bills

---

## Pitfalls to watch
- Revenue becomes harder to forecast
- Spiky bills can shock customers
- Requires solid telemetry and billing

---

## Setting up usage tracking systems
- Instrument features and log events
- Pipeline data into metering tools
- Data quality and alerts prevent disputes

---

## Pricing psychology
- Customers like control over spend
- Transparent calculators ease fear
- Humor and framing influence perception

---

## Churn prevention basics
Monitor adoption and support signals
before customers quietly disengage.

---

## Customer health scoring
Combine product usage, support tickets,
NPS and contract age into a single score.

---

## Acting on health scores
Target low-scoring accounts with
enablement or incentives before renewal.

---

## Key takeaway
Usage-based pricing ties price to value, and
health scoring catches churn before it bites.
