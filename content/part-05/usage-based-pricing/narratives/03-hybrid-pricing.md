Speaker 1: Pure usage sounds elegant, but many companies mix a base fee with metered add-ons.
Speaker 2: Like AWS reserved instances plus on-demand bursts, or Twilio's free tier followed by per-message charges.
Speaker 1: Exactly. A fixed retainer smooths cash flow and keeps the lights on during slow months.
Speaker 2: Actually, some CFOs prefer hybrids because they can forecast the base while still riding upside.
Speaker 1: For a student stepping into IT consulting, you'll quote a starter package then bill hourly overages.
Speaker 2: The tricky part is balancing perceived fairness. Too high a base and customers feel trapped.
Speaker 1: Too low and sudden usage spikes create terrifying "bill shock" memes in the finance channel.
Speaker 2: Hybrid models also help cover support costs that don't scale neatly with consumption.
Speaker 1: So hybrids act like phone plans: a small monthly fee plus extra when you stream cat videos nonstop.
Speaker 2: Done well, they blend predictability with flexibilityâ€”no treadmill, but still a safety rail.
