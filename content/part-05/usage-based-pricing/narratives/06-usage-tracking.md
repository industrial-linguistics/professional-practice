Speaker 1: Setting up usage tracking sounds boring until you realise revenue depends on it.
Speaker 2: Engineers need to instrument every feature, log events, and funnel them into a billing pipeline.
Speaker 1: Actually, legal teams care too—those logs double as compliance evidence when auditors come knocking.
Speaker 2: For someone new to IT, think of it like a fitness app counting steps; if sensors misfire, the stats lie.
Speaker 1: Choosing between building a metering service or buying one off the shelf is a heated debate.
Speaker 2: Build grants flexibility but means on-call duty when Kafka hiccups at 3 a.m.
Speaker 1: Buy reduces maintenance yet might not capture niche metrics your product needs.
Speaker 2: Data quality is king; duplicate events or timezone bugs can skew invoices and erode trust.
Speaker 1: So tracking systems require cross-team collaboration—product defines events, ops keeps pipelines running.
Speaker 2: Done well, they turn raw clicks into dollars, and maybe pay for the coffee fueling those late-night deployments.
