Speaker 1: Of course, usage-based models aren't magic and can backfire spectacularly.
Speaker 2: Remember that startup that forgot to cap AWS Lambda calls and woke up to a five-figure invoice?
Speaker 1: Forecasting revenue gets tricky when customers binge one month and ghost the next.
Speaker 2: Actually, finance teams may miss their cash-flow targets if metering data is delayed or inaccurate.
Speaker 1: Implementing metering is no small featâ€”engineers need reliable telemetry, audit trails, and billing integrations.
Speaker 2: For students eyeing DevOps roles, you'll be the one debugging those midnight "bill shock" alerts.
Speaker 1: Customers feel vulnerable too. If dashboards are vague, they fear an invoice that reads like a plot twist.
Speaker 2: That's why clear usage alerts and budgets matter; nobody wants a surprise worthy of a meme.
Speaker 1: And sometimes high-volume customers negotiate discounts, shrinking margins just when traffic spikes.
Speaker 2: So while flexible pricing is powerful, it demands discipline, communication, and coffee-fueled forecasting spreadsheets.
