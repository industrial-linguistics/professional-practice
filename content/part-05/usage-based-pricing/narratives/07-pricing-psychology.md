Speaker 1: Pricing isn't just math; it's psychology dressed in spreadsheets.
Speaker 2: Customers love feeling in control, so pay-per-use looks friendlier than a scary annual contract.
Speaker 1: Actually, anchoring plays a role. Showing a low per-unit price makes the service seem affordable.
Speaker 2: But if the units pile up, that "affordable" rate can morph into a shock, like eating too many $1 tacos.
Speaker 1: For someone starting in IT sales, framing matters: "only pennies per gig" sounds softer than "$200 a month." 
Speaker 2: There's also loss aversion—people hate paying for unused capacity, hence the shelfware jokes.
Speaker 1: Yet some buyers prefer flat fees because they fear surprises and love budgeting certainty.
Speaker 2: So a transparent calculator or simulated bill can soothe nerves and build trust.
Speaker 1: Even humorous touches—"warning: heavy meme uploads may increase costs"—keep things human.
Speaker 2: In short, pricing talks to emotions first and accountants second, so craft the message carefully.
