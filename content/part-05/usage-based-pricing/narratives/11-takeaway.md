Speaker 1: When pricing mirrors usage, customers feel they're paying for real value, not shelfware.
Speaker 2: And let's be honest, we've all bought software that now props up a monitor like a very expensive coaster.
Speaker 1: Pair usage pricing with health scoring and you spot trouble before contracts quietly lapse.
Speaker 2: Actually, the combo creates a feedback loop—billing data feeds scores, scores trigger outreach.
Speaker 1: For students entering the field, this means learning both analytics and empathy; spreadsheets meet people skills.
Speaker 2: It also affects cash flow forecasts, giving finance fewer surprises and fewer emergency doughnut runs.
Speaker 1: Don't forget internal culture—sharing scores openly encourages teams to rally around at-risk accounts.
Speaker 2: With humor too; a dashboard widget saying "This account needs a hug" keeps things human.
Speaker 1: Ultimately, usage-based models align price with value while health scores protect that relationship.
Speaker 2: Nail both and you graduate from vendor to trusted partner—and your software stays off the shelf.
