Speaker 2: Think of Net Promoter Score—NPS asks, "Would you recommend us?" from 0 to 10.
Speaker 1: Promoters minus detractors yields a number between -100 and 100; 50+ is great.
Speaker 2: Actually, combine that with metrics like weekly active users and support response time.
Speaker 1: For example, an account with 80% feature adoption, NPS 60, and zero open tickets might score 90/100.
Speaker 2: But if usage drops to 20% and NPS slides to 10, the score plummets, flashing bright red.
Speaker 1: Students entering customer success roles will wrangle spreadsheets merging these inputs daily.
Speaker 2: Don't forget contract age—renewals approaching soon should weight more heavily.
Speaker 1: The formula isn't universal; debate with your team to pick signals that truly predict churn.
Speaker 2: Otherwise you risk chasing vanity metrics while the real issues sprint out the back door.
