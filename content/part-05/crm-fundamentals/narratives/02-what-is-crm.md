Speaker 1: Picture this: a customer calls your help desk frustrated because their software isn't working. Without a CRM, the support rep starts from scratchâ€”"What's your account number? What product do you use? Have you contacted us before?"

Speaker 2: With a CRM, the rep instantly sees the customer's full history: previous tickets, known issues, contract details, even which sales engineer handled the implementation. It's like having a shared memory that never forgets and is available to sales, support, and success teams.

Speaker 1: When everyone works from the same record, nobody drops the ball and customers feel heard instead of repeating themselves.
