Speaker 1: Salesforce Trailhead is like a free gym membership for your CRM muscles. Start with CRM Basics to learn terminology, then move into Leads and Opportunities to practice qualifying prospects and tracking deals.

Speaker 2: The Accounts & Contacts trail shows how relationships are mapped, while Reports & Dashboards teaches you to spot trends without needing a data scientist. None of these modules turn you into a salesperson any more than learning Excel makes you an accountant, but they make you more valuable to any team.

Speaker 1: Each badge is a mini project you can show on your résumé or LinkedIn profile.
