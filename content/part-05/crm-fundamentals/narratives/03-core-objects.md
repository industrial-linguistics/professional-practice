Speaker 1: Salesforce organises data into standard objects that fit together like LEGO blocks. Accounts represent companies; Contacts store the people at those firms; Leads capture raw interest from marketing; and Opportunities track potential revenue.

Speaker 2: Suppose a lead from a tech expo becomes qualified. It converts into an Account named "TechCorp Inc." with Contacts like "John Smith, CTO" and "Sarah Lee, IT Manager." The sales team then opens an Opportunity to follow the deal through demos, proposals, and contracts.

Speaker 1: Keeping these relationships clean prevents the messy desk syndrome where vital details vanish under piles of sticky notes.
