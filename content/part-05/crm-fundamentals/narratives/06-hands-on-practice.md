Speaker 1: The best way to learn is by doing. Spin up a Trailhead Playground and experiment with creating accounts, logging support tickets, and running reports without fear of breaking anything.

Speaker 2: Guided projects walk you through real scenarios like converting a lead or building a dashboard for open incidents. You can replay steps until they stick and even explore API tools if you're feeling adventurous.

Speaker 1: Treat the playground as your lab benchâ€”practice the workflow, make mistakes, and document what you learn so you can bring that discipline back to production environments.
