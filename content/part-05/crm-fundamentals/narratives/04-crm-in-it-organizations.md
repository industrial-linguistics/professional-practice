Speaker 1: CRM isn't just for salespeople. In many IT organisations, the support desk lives in the same system so agents can see who the customer is, what infrastructure they run, and which SLAs apply before they even say hello.

Speaker 2: When incidents escalate, the CRM record links to the ITIL ticket, showing prior outages, open change requests, and the account's tier. That context helps engineers prioritise fixes and communicate appropriately. It's far better than hunting through inboxes like a messy desk for missing details.

Speaker 1: Aligning CRM and service management keeps technical teams customer aware and prevents surprises during critical calls.
