## Short Answer Questions

### 11. SLA Negotiation
**Question:** Describe one reason the course recommends negotiating detailed SLA terms instead of accepting "best effort" language.

**Sample Answer:**
"Best effort" wording provides little recourse when service levels slip, so negotiating specific uptime targets, response times and penalties ensures the vendor is accountable and gives the buyer leverage when incidents occur.

### 12. CRM-to-ITIL Alignment
**Question:** How does aligning CRM milestones with ITIL change processes help prevent customer-impacting incidents?

**Sample Answer:**
Linking stages like Proposal or Contract Sent to pre-change reviews surfaces risk assessments and scheduling conflicts before go-live, ensuring service teams are prepared and reducing the chance of unplanned outages when new commitments move into production.
