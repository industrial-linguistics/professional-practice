## Short Answer Questions

### 14. SLA Negotiation
**Question:** Describe one reason the course recommends negotiating detailed SLA terms instead of accepting "best effort" language.

**Sample Answer:**
"Best effort" wording provides little recourse when service levels slip, so negotiating specific uptime targets, response times and penalties ensures the vendor is accountable and gives the buyer leverage when incidents occur.

### 15. CRM-to-ITIL Alignment
**Question:** How does aligning CRM milestones with ITIL change processes help prevent customer-impacting incidents?

**Sample Answer:**
Linking stages like Proposal or Contract Sent to pre-change reviews surfaces risk assessments and scheduling conflicts before go-live, ensuring service teams are prepared and reducing the chance of unplanned outages when new commitments move into production.

### 16. Customer Success Metrics
**Question:** What is one proactive step a customer success manager can take when health scores dip, according to the course content?

**Sample Answer:**
They can schedule an executive check-in to revisit the success plan, align on adoption blockers, and offer targeted enablement before churn risks accelerate.

## Scenario-Based Questions

### 17. Vendor Evaluation Scenario
**Question:** Your scoring matrix shows Vendor A excels in functionality but lags in security certifications, while Vendor B meets every compliance requirement but has weaker roadmap alignment. How should the evaluation team proceed?

**Sample Answer:**
Validate whether the security gaps can be remediated contractually or through third-party attestations; if not, prioritise Vendor B's compliance posture and request roadmap commitments, because regulatory risk outweighs feature gaps.

### 18. Proof-of-Concept Scenario
**Question:** A proof-of-concept is running behind schedule because the customer cannot supply anonymised datasets. What mitigation does the course recommend?

**Sample Answer:**
Escalate through the agreed communication channel, offer vendor-provided sample data aligned to the success criteria, and document an updated timeline so the go/no-go decision is still backed by objective results.
