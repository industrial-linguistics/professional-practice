# Proof-of-Concept Management
*Testing ideas before full commitment*

---

## Why run a proof of concept?

Running a small trial reduces risk before signing a long contract. Teams can validate functionality, integration and user fit without a full deployment. A short experiment uncovers deal-breakers early and builds evidence to support or reject the vendor.
- Because "it works on the vendor's laptop" isn't a business case

---

## Define success upfront

- Agree on measurable outcomes like page load times under three seconds or an 80% user satisfaction score.
- Capture a baseline so improvements are clear.
- Distinguish must-have criteria from nice-to-have bonuses.

---

## Manage scope and timeline

- Limit participants, datasets and integrations.
- Example: a marketing team tests a CRM with 10 users and 100 sample leads for two weeks.
- Assign a project lead, vendor contact and schedule regular check-ins.
- Set a modest budget and update stakeholders regularly to avoid POC creep.

---

## Evaluate and document outcomes

- Consider evaluation criteria such as cost per user, integration complexity and training requirements.
- Gather metrics and feedback at the end of the trial.
- Keep the vendor on schedule—don't let them drag out the trial hoping you'll forget the initial criteria.
- Decide on go, no-go or adjust and rerun. Share a brief report so leadership understands the recommendation and any follow-up work.

---

## Common POC mistakes

- Free trials that aren't really free.
- Testing with unrealistic or cherry-picked data.
- Letting POC creep turn into a mini project.

---

## ROI calculation

- Track staff time, licensing and infrastructure costs.
- Compare against potential savings or revenue gains.
- Document assumptions so stakeholders see the math.

---

## Exit strategy

- Define criteria to end the trial early if it fails.
- Communicate the decision and lessons learned to stakeholders and the vendor.

---

## Key takeaway

A good POC either saves you money or makes you money. A bad POC does both—for the vendor. Disciplined POC management sets expectations, controls risk and provides evidence for investment decisions.
