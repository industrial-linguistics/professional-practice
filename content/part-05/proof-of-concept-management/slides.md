# Proof-of-Concept Management
*Testing ideas before full commitment*

---

## Why run a proof of concept?

Running a small trial reduces risk before signing a long contract. Teams can validate functionality, integration and user fit without a full deployment. A short experiment uncovers deal‑breakers early and builds evidence to support or reject the vendor.

---

## Define success upfront

- Agree on measurable outcomes like latency targets or user satisfaction.
- Capture a baseline so improvements are clear.
- Distinguish must‑have criteria from nice‑to‑have bonuses.

---

## Manage scope and timeline

- Limit participants, datasets and integrations.
- Assign a project lead and schedule regular check‑ins.
- Treat the POC like a sprint with a clear start and end date.

---

## Evaluate and document outcomes

Gather metrics and feedback at the end of the trial. Decide on go, no‑go or adjust and rerun. Share a brief report so leadership understands the recommendation and any follow‑up work.

---

## Key takeaway

Disciplined POC management sets expectations, controls risk and provides evidence for investment decisions.
