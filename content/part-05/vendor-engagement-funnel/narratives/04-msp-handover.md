Speaker 2: Usually right after the contract, once the sales team vanishes and the real work starts.
Speaker 1: They promise to take the pain away, but someone still has to manage the people managing the pain.

Speaker 2: Then tickets ping-pong, costs rise and everyone wonders what they signed up for. Clear handovers and check-ins keep it tidy.
