title: Vendor Engagement Funnel & MSP Hand-overs

# Vendor Engagement Funnel
*Knowing when to pass the baton*

---

## Why structure the funnel?
A clear funnel keeps vendor discussions organised and sets expectations for every stage. Without it, teams skip due diligence or stall during hand-offs. Mapping the journey early also flags the points where managed service providers step in.

---

## Funnel stages
1. Awareness and initial outreach
2. Qualification and needs discovery
3. Proposal review and due diligence
4. Contracting and onboarding
5. Operation and continual improvement

---

## MSP hand-over points
- Pre-sales consultants hand off to delivery teams after contracts are signed
- During onboarding, internal staff transfer routine tasks as playbooks mature
- Once steady state is reached, account managers run reviews and manage escalations

---

## Key takeaway
Defining funnel stages and hand-over points keeps vendor engagements on track and ensures a smooth transition to managed services.
