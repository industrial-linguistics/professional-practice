# Vendor Engagement Funnel
*Knowing when to pass the baton*

---

## Why structure the funnel?
Without a clear funnel, vendor discussions become chaotic. Teams skip due diligence, procurement gets blindsided by sudden contract requests, and expensive tools get deployed without proper change management. Imagine your university decides it needs a new student management system and a Salesforce rep promises the world. Without structure, IT might only hear about it when the contract lands on their desk. A defined funnel forces stakeholders—IT, finance, legal and end users—to compare options, document requirements and schedule handovers to MSPs. It also exposes cost creep early, preventing situations where a simple email upgrade morphs into a full digital transformation project.

## Funnel stages, timelines and players
1. **Awareness & outreach** – a few days of research; IT and business units scan options like Microsoft 365, AWS or local consultants.  
2. **Qualification & discovery** – weeks of workshops to validate budget and scope; finance checks costs while end users explain pain points.  
3. **Proposal review & due diligence** – one to three weeks; legal vets terms and security reviews SaaS versus managed service implications.  
4. **Contracting & onboarding** – several weeks of negotiation and setup, often involving procurement specialists and MSP delivery leads.  
5. **Operate & improve** – ongoing; account managers track service levels and satisfaction to decide on renewals or replacements.  
Structured stages keep SaaS vendors, consultants and MSPs in the right lanes.

## MSP hand-over points
Managed service providers (MSPs) run day-to-day operations once the fancy sales talk ends. Handovers usually happen right after contracts are signed and the sales team retreats. During onboarding, internal staff document playbooks so routine tasks—say backing up an accounting firm's files to AWS—can shift to the MSP. The challenge is that MSPs promise to take the pain away, yet someone still has to manage the people managing the pain. If requirements are half-baked or communication is vague, tickets bounce around and costs spike. Clear transition meetings and shared runbooks keep everyone honest.

## Pitfalls, metrics and takeaways
- **Scope creep**: without guardrails, a quick SaaS trial balloons into a pricey consulting engagement.  
- **Poor communication**: forgetting to loop in finance or legal delays sign-off for weeks.  
- **Unclear handovers**: MSPs receive vague requirements and spend billable hours guessing.  
To know the funnel is working, track time from first contact to contract, measure service quality through KPIs like incident response times, and survey end users after go-live. Remember: write down requirements, agree on who owns each stage, and review vendor performance regularly. A little discipline now saves budget and stress later.

## Careers in vendor engagement
Understanding this funnel opens doors to roles such as Vendor Manager, Account Manager, Procurement Specialist and MSP Delivery Lead. Graduates often start as procurement or finance analysts, junior account reps or service desk staff before moving into vendor-facing positions. Mid-level professionals coordinate contracts and run quarterly business reviews, while senior leaders negotiate multi-year deals or manage entire MSP portfolios. Strong communication, curiosity and a bit of skepticism help in these careers. For students, internships with vendors like Microsoft or consultancy firms can be a stepping stone, and certifications in ITIL or contract management add credibility.
