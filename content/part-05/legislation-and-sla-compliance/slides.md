# Legislation and SLA Compliance
*Building contracts that respect global privacy law*

---

## Why legislation matters in SLAs
Speaker A: We keep talking about "strong SLAs". Why drag privacy law into a commercial contract?
Speaker B: Because regulators do not care that a vendor missed its target. If personal data leaks, the customer of record is still on the hook.
Speaker A: So we use the contract to push legal obligations onto the vendor?
Speaker B: Exactly. SLAs need clauses that align with statutory duties, otherwise fines and breach notifications land on us.
Speaker A: Think of legislation as the non-negotiable baseline before we even discuss uptime numbers.

## Australia’s Privacy Act 1988 (APP 11)
Speaker A: What does APP 11 actually require from a SaaS provider?
Speaker B: It demands reasonable steps to secure personal information and to destroy or de-identify it once it is no longer needed.
Speaker A: In an SLA we convert that into encryption standards, breach notification timelines and secure disposal guarantees.
Speaker B: We also need audit rights to prove those "reasonable steps" exist. Without evidence, we cannot defend ourselves to the OAIC.
Speaker A: Include joint incident response drills so vendors are not improvising when something goes wrong.

## Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018
Speaker A: Some clients insist on Critical Infrastructure Act coverage. What changes in the contract?
Speaker B: The Act mandates risk management programs, rapid reporting and government access for declared systems.
Speaker A: So SLAs must reference the customer’s critical asset register and specify how the vendor supports 12-hour incident notifications.
Speaker B: We also need clauses for mandatory cyber incident reports and cooperation with the Australian Signals Directorate.
Speaker A: If the vendor cannot meet those obligations, they are not a fit for essential services customers.

## EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
Speaker A: GDPR penalties can hit 4% of global turnover. How do we flow that risk down?
Speaker B: Add Data Processing Agreements that mirror Articles 28–32—lawful processing instructions, sub-processor approval, and technical safeguards.
Speaker A: Cross-border transfers require Standard Contractual Clauses or an adequacy mechanism baked into the SLA.
Speaker B: Right-to-erasure and data subject access requests need service levels too; 30 days is the legal clock.
Speaker A: Regular penetration tests and encryption at rest/in transit should be contractually required, not just "best effort" promises.

## China’s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL)
Speaker A: PIPL feels similar to GDPR but with sharper edges. What do we contract for?
Speaker B: Explicit consent and data localisation are front and centre. Vendors hosting Chinese citizen data must keep it on approved infrastructure.
Speaker A: We negotiate onshore hosting commitments, security assessments for cross-border transfers, and clear data classification responsibilities.
Speaker B: Breach reporting is on a tight timeline, and regulators can pause exports, so vendors need contingency capacity inside China.
Speaker A: Without those assurances, we risk suspension of operations in the world’s largest market.

## Practical checklist for vendor negotiations
Speaker A: How do we keep all these laws straight during negotiations?
Speaker B: Use a compliance matrix mapping each legislation to concrete contract clauses, evidence requirements and reporting SLAs.
Speaker A: Involve legal, security and privacy officers early so they can review the draft before procurement signs.
Speaker B: Require periodic attestations—SOC 2, ISO 27001, IRAP—as proof that controls are still operating.
Speaker A: Update your playbooks annually; legislation evolves and so should the contracts.
Speaker B: Treat compliance like uptime: measure it, report on it, and make it enforceable.

## Key takeaway
Speaker A: SLAs are not just promises between two companies.
Speaker B: They are the tools we use to comply with national and international privacy regimes.
Speaker A: Translate each law—Privacy Act, Critical Infrastructure, GDPR, PIPL—into precise obligations.
Speaker B: Demand evidence, joint response plans and localisation commitments where required.
Speaker A: When regulators come knocking, the contract should show we planned for the worst.
Speaker B: Good compliance clauses protect the business just as much as any uptime guarantee.
