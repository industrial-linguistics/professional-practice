Speaker 1: We split scoring signals into explicit and implicit.
Speaker 2: Explicit means facts about the leadâ€”industry, company size, job title, tech stack compatibility.
Speaker 1: Implicit signals show intent, like downloading the pricing guide, attending a webinar or requesting a sandbox.
Speaker 2: Marketing and sales must agree on what score equals "marketing-qualified" so hand-offs are automatic, not debate material.
Speaker 1: Document those definitions inside the CRM fields and playbooks so new hires follow the same rules from day one.
