# Lead Scoring & Renewal Signals
*Keeping CRM pipelines healthy*

---

## Why scoring and alerts matter

Sales teams juggle dozens of leads and renewal dates. Without a system, hot prospects cool off and at-risk renewals slip. Lead scoring ranks prospects using behaviour and firmographic signals so reps focus on the right conversations. Renewal alerts surface usage dips or contract anniversaries before customers churn. Together they turn the CRM from a database into a proactive workflow coach.

## Lead scoring fundamentals

Assign points for traits that correlate with wins. Explicit data covers company size, industry fit or decision-maker seniority. Implicit signals track engagement—email opens, webinar attendance, product trials. Define what counts as "marketing-qualified" versus "sales-qualified" and document it in the CRM so automation knows when to hand leads between teams.

---

## Building the scoring model

Start simple: +10 points for ICP industry, +5 for director-level titles, +15 for a demo request. Subtract points for students or competitors. Review closed-won data quarterly to adjust weights. Tools like HubSpot, Salesforce or Pipedrive support formula fields or Einstein/AI scoring, but the logic should remain transparent so sellers trust the numbers.

---

## Opportunity stage progression

Create clear exit criteria for each pipeline stage—"Qualified" means budget, authority, need and timeline confirmed. "Proposal" requires pricing sent and mutual action plan agreed. Reps should update close dates and next steps on every call. Consistent hygiene powers forecasting accuracy and makes pipeline reviews collaborative instead of interrogations.

---

## Automation and task queues

Use CRM workflows to convert high-scoring leads into opportunities, notify account executives and add tasks. Sequence emails can nurture mid-tier scores until they are ready. When opportunities stagnate past the expected duration, trigger reminders or manager check-ins. Automations keep momentum without relying on memory.

---

## Renewal alerts and health signals

Tag every account with contract start, renewal and notice periods. Integrate product usage or support ticket data to flag declining logins, low NPS or unresolved issues. Create dashboards showing accounts 120/90/60 days from renewal with health colour codes. Customer success and sales should meet monthly to action the list before any surprises reach the finance team.

---

## Metrics to track

Monitor lead-to-opportunity conversion, average score of closed-won deals, stage aging and renewal retention rate. Compare forecast accuracy before and after automation. Share insights with marketing so campaign targeting reflects real buyer behaviour. Metrics turn anecdotal pipeline conversations into measurable improvements.

---

## Careers and collaboration

Revenue operations analysts design scoring models, marketing operations maintain automations and customer success managers interpret renewal signals. Entry-level coordinators might clean data or build reports before progressing to RevOps manager or lifecycle marketing roles. Soft skills like stakeholder facilitation and curiosity about customer behaviour make these careers thrive.

---

## Key takeaway

Lead scoring, disciplined stage management and proactive renewal alerts keep revenue teams focused on the right actions at the right time. Start with simple rules, automate hand-offs and continuously refine using closed-loop data. The CRM then becomes the nerve centre of predictable growth rather than a graveyard of stale records.
