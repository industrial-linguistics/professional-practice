# Competitive Displacement Strategies
*Winning over customers in crowded markets*

---

## What is displacement?
- Replacing an incumbent vendor with your solution
- Requires solving pain points the competitor misses
- Common where markets are saturated and contracts lock clients in

---

## Research the incumbent
- "Incumbent vendor" = the tool or provider already in use
- Analyse competitor features, pricing and support reputation
- Gather customer complaints and reviews to find weaknesses
- If ServiceNow tickets take 3 days for first response, showcase your 4‑hour SLA
- Map internal champions and existing relationships

---

## Targeted differentiation
- Lead with unique value that addresses known pain
- Provide clear ROI and transparent pricing
- Use side-by-side comparisons to highlight advantages

---

## Structured migration plan
- Outline steps, timelines and resources for moving off the old platform
- Explain data migration: moving records, tickets and user accounts
- Offer tooling, data migration support and training
- Example: from Zendesk to ServiceNow with CSV exports, field mapping and a 3‑month parallel run
- Set realistic timelines—enterprise swaps often take 6‑12 months
- Reduce risk with pilots or phased rollouts and proof‑of‑concept testing

---

## Land and expand
- Start with a foothold project or department
- Demonstrate quick wins then broaden adoption
- Example: begin with HR ticket management, then move to IT ops after 50% faster resolutions
- Track success metrics to justify expansion
- Maintain champions to secure renewal

---

## Ethics and professionalism
- Emphasise your strengths rather than spreading FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt)
- Respect contract terms and confidentiality
- Build trust so displacement feels like partnership

---

## Roles and career paths
- Sales Engineers validate solutions and design migrations
- Customer Success Managers manage stakeholder relationships
- Solution Architects plan long‑term expansions
- Junior reps surface pain points; senior staff orchestrate the swap

---

## Key takeaway
Successful displacement solves real pain, eases migration risk and stays ethical.
