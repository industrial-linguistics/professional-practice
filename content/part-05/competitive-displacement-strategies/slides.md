# Competitive Displacement Strategies
*Winning over customers in crowded markets*

---

## What is displacement?
- Replacing an incumbent vendor with your solution
- Requires solving pain points the competitor misses
- Common where markets are saturated and contracts lock clients in

---

## Research the incumbent
- Analyse competitor features, pricing and support reputation
- Gather customer complaints and reviews to find weaknesses
- Understand switching costs and migration fears

---

## Targeted differentiation
- Lead with unique value that addresses known pain
- Provide clear ROI and transparent pricing
- Use side-by-side comparisons to highlight advantages

---

## Structured migration plan
- Outline steps, timelines and resources for moving off the old platform
- Offer tooling, data migration support and training
- Reduce risk with pilots or phased rollouts

---

## Land and expand
- Start with a foothold project or department
- Demonstrate quick wins then broaden adoption
- Maintain champions to secure renewal

---

## Ethics and professionalism
- Emphasise your strengths rather than spreading FUD
- Respect contract terms and confidentiality
- Build trust so displacement feels like partnership

---

## Key takeaway
Successful displacement solves real pain, eases migration risk and stays ethical.
