# Salesforce Opportunity Walkthrough
*From curious lead to signed deal*

### Learning objectives
- Follow a practical Salesforce flow for progressing a B2B tech opportunity
- Understand which fields and artifacts matter at each stage
- See where sales, solution and service teams collaborate before close

---

## Scenario setup

We play the role of an Account Executive at CloudOps Solutions, selling a managed DevOps platform. Our prospect is RiverBank, a
 regional financial services firm modernising its release process. We'll use Salesforce Lightning to capture data, automate task
s and coordinate with pre-sales and delivery teams.

---

## Step 1 – Capture the lead

- Marketing imports RiverBank CTO Priya Shah from a webinar list
- Lead record includes industry, company size, compliance needs
- Auto-assigned to the enterprise sales queue with nurture emails paused
- Initial task: call within 24 hours to confirm interest and challenges

---

## Step 2 – Qualify and convert

- Discovery call confirms budget, authority, need and timeline (BANT)
- Update lead status to *Qualified* and capture notes on incident pain points
- Convert lead → create Account "RiverBank", Contact "Priya Shah", and Opportunity "RiverBank – DevOps Platform"
- Assign solution engineer and customer success partner during conversion

---

## Step 3 – Discovery & stage progression

- Opportunity enters *Discovery* stage with exit criteria: documented current toolchain, change cadence, regulatory constraints
- Log discovery meeting tasks and attach call recordings
- Create Salesforce Path guidance reminders for security questionnaires and stakeholder mapping
- Kick off shared notes doc for sales, SE and service transition manager

---

## Step 4 – Solution design and change alignment

- Move to *Solution Proposed* when architecture draft and success metrics are defined
- Upload proposal deck, ROI model and draft change impact assessment
- Trigger automation to open a provisional ITIL change record with target go-live window
- Schedule internal deal review with product, legal and service delivery leads

---

## Step 5 – Proposal, negotiation and approvals

- Generate formal quote via CPQ, capturing pricing, term length and SLA tier
- Capture security review status and attach signed data processing agreements
- Track executive sponsor commitment and procurement steps in opportunity fields
- Use Salesforce approvals to route discount requests and contract exceptions

---

## Step 6 – Closing and handoff

- Once procurement confirms, set stage to *Closed Won* and populate closed date and win reasons
- Auto-create implementation project in PSA or ServiceNow with attached proposal artifacts
- Notify finance for invoicing and customer success for onboarding cadence
- Log final mutual action plan tasks to keep post-sale teams aligned

---

## Step 7 – Post-close follow-through

- Monitor onboarding tasks via project dashboard and update opportunity follow-up field at 30/60/90 days
- Capture customer health updates and initial usage metrics linked to the account
- Schedule QBR and renewal reminder campaigns once the platform is live
- Feed lessons learned back into marketing persona and playbooks

---

## Roles and growth paths

- **Account Executive** orchestrates the opportunity and stakeholder management
- **Solution Engineer** validates technical fit and risk mitigations
- **Service Transition Manager** ensures ITIL change preparation and onboarding readiness
- Skills gained—Salesforce automation, mutual plans, compliance coordination—set up progression into enterprise sales leadership
or revenue operations

---

## Key takeaway

Walking an opportunity from lead to close in Salesforce is about disciplined data capture, cross-functional coordination and ear
ly alignment with delivery teams. Master these habits and you become the connective tissue between promise and value realization.
