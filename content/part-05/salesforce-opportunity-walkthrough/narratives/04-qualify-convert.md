Speaker 1: During the first call we confirm BANT—budget, authority, need, and timeline. Priya wants to cut incident-related change failures in half before year-end.

Speaker 2: Once qualified, we convert the lead. Salesforce creates the account, contact and opportunity records in one move. We also assign our solution engineer Sarah—she speaks fluent compliance—and our customer success partner Mike, who has yet to meet a regulatory framework he couldn't charm, so discovery is collaborative from day one.
