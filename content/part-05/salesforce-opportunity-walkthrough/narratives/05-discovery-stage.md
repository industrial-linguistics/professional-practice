Speaker 1: In discovery we document the current release process, incident history and compliance guardrails.

Speaker 2: Salesforce Path guidance nudges us to attach agendas, meeting notes and stakeholder maps.

The shared notes doc keeps sales, engineering and service transition aligned on what we learn.
