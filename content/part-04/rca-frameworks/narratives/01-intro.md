Speaker 1: We've spent time exploring how to hold post-mortems without pointing fingers. Now we need a toolkit for digging into the technical reasons behind failures. We'll cover two proven methods: the Five Whys and the fishbone diagram. Each provides a step-by-step path to go beyond symptoms and uncover the underlying system weaknesses.
Speaker 2: Using a framework keeps the conversation grounded in evidence rather than opinions. Everyone participates by examining facts, which builds a shared understanding of the incident. These methods also help with documentation, since the process itself guides what to record. We'll see how they fit into the overall post-mortem workflow and how you can apply them in your own environment.
