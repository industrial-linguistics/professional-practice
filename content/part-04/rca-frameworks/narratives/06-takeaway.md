Speaker 1: Whether you prefer the simplicity of Five Whys or the visual power of a fishbone diagram, the goal is the same: uncover the underlying cause so you can fix it for good. Treat each incident as a chance to strengthen your system, not as a failure to hide. When done consistently, these frameworks build a culture of learning.
Speaker 2: Make it a habit to share your findings with the whole team and to track the resulting action items. Over time you'll see patterns in your incident trends and you'll develop a more robust improvement process. Mastering these analysis techniques is a valuable skill for any IT professional who wants to lead problem management efforts.
