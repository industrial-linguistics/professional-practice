Speaker 1: Without a framework, teams often jump straight to a fix and miss patterns hiding in the data. When we slow down and follow a structured approach, every step requires evidence. This keeps the analysis objective and prevents the conversation from veering into blame or guesses.
Speaker 2: Frameworks also save time over the long run because they are repeatable. If each incident is analysed differently, new members struggle to learn. By following a shared checklist, we build a knowledge base of root causes, which in turn improves reliability metrics like MTTR. Studies show companies using consistent RCA methods cut repeat incidents by over fifty percent.
