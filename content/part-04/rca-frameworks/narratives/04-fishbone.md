Speaker 1: A fishbone diagram looks like the skeleton of a fish, with the issue at the head and major cause categories branching off the spine. Common categories include People, Process, Technology, Environment, Materials, and Methods. For each branch you list possible contributing factors. In an IT context, the "Technology" branch might include network configuration, while "Process" could reveal gaps in change management.
Speaker 2: This technique works well when failures have several intertwined causes. The visual layout helps teams brainstorm systematically without losing track of ideas. As you fill in the branches, patterns emerge that highlight where to investigate first. Draw the diagram on a whiteboard or in collaboration software so everyone can contribute. It's also a good way to record findings for future reference.
