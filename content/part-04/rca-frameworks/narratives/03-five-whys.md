Speaker 1: The Five Whys method begins with the problem statement. Let's say a website went offline. We ask, "Why was the site down?" The first answer might be "The database became unreachable." We then ask, "Why was the database unreachable?" Maybe "Because a deployment script changed the network settings." The next why digs deeper: "Why did the script change them?" Because there was no peer review before the deploy. "Why wasn't there a review?" Because our automation pipeline doesn't enforce it. At the fifth why we discover the real issue: the pipeline needs a mandatory approval step.
Speaker 2: The trick is not to stop after the second or third why. Each answer should be backed by evidence so we avoid speculation. It's easy to fall into solution mode too early, but the point is to expose the hidden weakness in the process. Document each question and answer chain so others can follow the logic later.
