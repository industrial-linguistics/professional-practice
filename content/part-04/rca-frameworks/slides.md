# Root Cause Analysis Frameworks
*Using structured approaches to find why things fail*

---

## Why use a framework?
- Moves discussion from blame to causes
- Provides a repeatable structure
- Helps teams collaborate on facts
- Records findings for future reviews

---

## The Five Whys
- Start with the observed symptom
- Ask "why" until the root cause appears
- Example: website down → misconfigured script → missing peer review
- Avoid stopping before evidence runs out

---

## Fishbone diagrams
- Visualise categories: People, Process, Technology, Environment, Materials, Methods
- Brainstorm potential contributors in each branch
- Useful for multifactor problems or when Five Whys stalls
- Document the diagram in the post-mortem

---

## Choosing the right approach
- Begin with Five Whys for straightforward chains
- Switch to Fishbone for complex interactions
- Combine approaches when needed
- Capture all questions and evidence
- Feed outcomes into problem tickets

---

## Key takeaway
- Structured analysis methods reveal true causes so improvements target the real problem.
- They support team learning and lasting improvements.
