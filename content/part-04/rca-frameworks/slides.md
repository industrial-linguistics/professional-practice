# Root Cause Analysis Frameworks
*Using structured approaches to find why things fail*

---

## Why use a framework?
- Moves discussion from blame to causes
- Provides a repeatable structure
- Helps teams collaborate on facts

---

## The Five Whys
- Ask "why" repeatedly until the underlying cause emerges
- Works well for straightforward issues
- Keep digging until answers stop revealing new info

---

## Fishbone diagrams
- Visualise categories like process, people, and tools
- Brainstorm potential contributors in each branch
- Great for complex or multifactor problems

---

## Choosing the right approach
- Start simple with Five Whys
- Use Fishbone when several factors interact
- Document findings to feed into post-mortems

---

## Key takeaway
Structured analysis methods reveal true causes so improvements target the real problem.
