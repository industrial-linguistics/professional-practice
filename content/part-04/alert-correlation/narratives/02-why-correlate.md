Speaker 1: Alert correlation groups related notifications so you aren't chasing separate fires that stem from the same spark.
Speaker 2: Think about that time the database slowed down and suddenly we had ten different services throwing errors.
Speaker 1: By viewing them together, we realized it was all one issue and ignored the noise.
Speaker 2: It also cuts down on false positives. If multiple sensors complain but share the same timestamp, it's probably one real problem, not ten.
Speaker 1: Correlation keeps us focused on fixing what's broken instead of firefighting every alert in sight.
