# Part 4 – Blameless RCA & Continuous Improvement

This part focuses on establishing a culture of learning from incidents without assigning blame, and using structured approaches to drive service improvements.

## Objectives

- Explain the mindset behind blameless post‑mortems and why psychological safety matters for learning.
- Apply the five‑whys technique to uncover contributing causes of failures.
- Differentiate between Kaizen style continuous improvement and corrective action plans.
- Trace how RCA tickets link between ServiceNow and GitHub issues.
- Use metrics from previous incidents to verify that improvements are effective.
- Schedule post‑mortem meetings within 24–48 hours and ensure key roles are present.
- Communicate findings to leadership in constructive terms and track follow‑up actions without blame.

## Key Topics

- Post‑mortem culture: fostering open discussion and avoiding finger‑pointing.
- Root cause analysis frameworks such as five‑whys and fishbone diagrams.
- Kaizen versus corrective actions, and when to use each approach.
- Integrating RCA records with ServiceNow problem tickets and GitHub issues.
- Tracking improvement through deployment metrics and incident trends.
- Typical post‑mortem agenda, attendee roles and documentation standards.
- Managing emotions and cultural barriers to blameless discussions.
- Communicating outcomes and tracking action items for accountability.
- Alert correlation and incident timeline reconstruction techniques.
- Log analysis methods and using Git blame constructively (yes, the name is ironic!).
- Metrics to monitor: MTTR trends, recurrence rates and action item completion.
