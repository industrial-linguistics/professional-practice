Speaker 1: If you've ever wondered whether your quick fix actually solved anything or simply moved the problem somewhere else, this module is for you. We've all attended post-mortems where action items pile up, yet nobody checks whether those items had any real impact.
Speaker 2: That's why we track deployment metrics and incident trends. Numbers give us an unbiased view of progress. We'll look at tools like GitHub Insights, JIRA reports and monitoring dashboards that make collecting this data easier than it sounds.
Speaker 1: We'll also talk about establishing a baseline before changes and how long it typically takes to see meaningful trends. By the end you'll know which metrics matter, common pitfalls to avoid and how these measurements help teams improve week after week.
