Speaker 1: Let's start with the basicsâ€”DORA metrics. Track deployment frequency, lead time for changes, change failure rate and mean time to recovery. These reveal how smoothly code travels from commit to production.
Speaker 2: To gather them, use GitHub Insights or your CI/CD dashboard for deployment stats and JIRA or ServiceNow for incident logs. Establish a baseline before you roll out new processes so you can see the effect over time.
Speaker 1: Good values differ by organisation, but watch for high failure rates or long recovery times. They often hint at inadequate testing or rushed releases. Connect these numbers to user experience: slower recovery means customers stuck on error pages longer.
Speaker 2: Don't forget incident counts and severities. Plot everything on a timeline. If deployments spike but incident severity climbs with them, it might be time to revisit your quality gates rather than celebrate extra releases.
