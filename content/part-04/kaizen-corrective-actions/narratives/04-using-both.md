Speaker 1: So Kaizen is like eating your vegetables, and corrective actions are like taking medicine when you're sick?
Speaker 2: That's a fitting comparison. Kaizen keeps the system healthy day to day, while corrective actions cure the nasty surprises.
Speaker 1: In practice, teams track Kaizen ideas on a backlog and review them at weekly stand-ups. Corrective actions get their own tickets with deadlines and verification steps.
Speaker 2: The key is making sure they complement each other. If a corrective action uncovers a wider process gap, turn it into a series of Kaizen tasks.
Speaker 1: Metrics help hereâ€”count how many Kaizen ideas get completed each month and monitor how many corrective actions actually prevent repeat incidents.
