Speaker 1: So Kaizen is like eating your vegetables, and corrective actions are like taking medicine when you're sick?
Speaker 2: Exactly. Kaizen keeps the system healthy day to day, while corrective actions cure the nasty surprises.
Speaker 1: Teams track Kaizen ideas on an improvement list and review them at weekly stand‑ups. Corrective actions get their own tickets with deadlines and verification steps.
Speaker 2: One team posts its "Kaizen wins" on a dashboard—they average a dozen small improvements each month and cut incident tickets by forty percent over six months.
Speaker 1: The key is making sure the two approaches complement each other. If a corrective action reveals a process gap, spin off related Kaizen tasks.
Speaker 2: That workflow lines up with ITIL and DevOps practices: continuous improvement feeds the pipeline and corrective actions keep it honest.
