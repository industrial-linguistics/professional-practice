Speaker 1: Corrective actions kick in when something serious happens, like the email server crashing at 3am or an auditor flagging a missing approval.
Speaker 2: The first step is a clear investigation to uncover the root cause. Then we plan and document the fix, assign an owner and set a deadline.
Speaker 1: After the fix is implemented, we verify it worked and record the evidence. Tracking each step prevents the same issue from slipping back in months later.
Speaker 2: Because corrective actions are so formal, they often involve management sign-off and extra documentation in tools like ServiceNow.
Speaker 1: They take more time than Kaizen, but they provide assurance that serious problems won't catch us off guard again.
