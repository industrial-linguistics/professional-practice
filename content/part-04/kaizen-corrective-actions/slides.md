# Kaizen vs Corrective Actions
*When to iterate and when to fix what broke*

---

## What is Kaizen?
- Ongoing, small improvements
- Employee-driven suggestions
- Embedded in daily work
- Builds a culture of learning

---

## What are Corrective Actions?
- Specific fixes after an incident
- Address non-conformities or failures
- Often mandated by policy or audit
- Tracked to closure

---

## When to use Kaizen
- Routine processes need gradual tuning
- Teams seek continuous efficiency gains
- Low risk changes rolled out often

---

## When to use Corrective Actions
- Serious outage or safety issue occurs
- Compliance or contractual breaches
- Root cause demands a targeted fix

---

## Using both together
- Kaizen surfaces improvement ideas before failures
- Corrective actions handle the big issues
- Each feeds the other: lessons learned become future Kaizen tasks

---

## Key takeaway
- Continuous improvement and corrective actions are complementary
- Choose Kaizen for incremental progress
- Use corrective actions to prevent repeat incidents
