Speaker 1: Putting it all together starts with a shared document right after the incident. Capture timelines, logs, and team observations while the details are fresh.

Speaker 2: Within 24 hours, summarise those findings in a ServiceNow problem ticket so managers have a clear view. Then create GitHub issues for each action item and link them back to that ticket.

Speaker 1: During improvement meetings, review the problem record and its linked issues to check progress. For example, the outage occurred at 2:45 PM, was resolved by 4:30 PM, and the fix was deployed two days later. Keeping that timeline in one place ensures nothing from the RCA gets forgotten once the incident fades.
