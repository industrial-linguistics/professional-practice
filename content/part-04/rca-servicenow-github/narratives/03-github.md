Speaker 1: After the problem record is in place, open a GitHub issue for each improvement task. A helpful title might be "Increase DB connection pool size - PRB0001234," not just "Fix database."

Speaker 2: In the description, reference the ServiceNow ticket and explain the business impact. That cross-link lets developers see why the work matters without leaving GitHub. As code changes move through pull requests, mention the issue number so everything stays connected.

Speaker 1: Once the fix is deployed and verified, close the GitHub issue and update the ServiceNow record. Now both systems tell the same story.
