# RCA Records in ServiceNow & GitHub
*Keeping post-mortems linked to your backlog*

---

## Why link RCA to problem tickets?
- Captures root cause in a central platform
- Connects incidents to ongoing work
- Provides audit trail for compliance
- Helps track improvement progress

---

## ServiceNow problem records
- Record timeline and contributing factors
- Link related incidents and changes
- Store workaround and final fix
- Assign owner and target date

---

## GitHub issue references
- Create issues for code and docs updates
- Mention ServiceNow ticket number
- Cross-link commits and pull requests
- Close issue when fix deployed

---

## Putting it all together
- Post-mortem notes become problem record
- Create GitHub issue for each action item
- Include links in both systems
- Review status during improvement meetings

---

## Key takeaway
- Integrated records keep teams aligned
- ServiceNow tracks process; GitHub tracks code
- Clear links make audits and follow-ups easy
