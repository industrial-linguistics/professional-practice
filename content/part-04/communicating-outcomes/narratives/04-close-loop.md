Speaker 1: Communication doesn't end once the meeting wraps up.
Speaker 2: Keep posting updates in the same ticket or chat thread so there's a single place to see progress.
Speaker 1: When a fix is deployed, share a quick note such as: "Patch deployed to production at 22:00 UTC. Monitoring looks good."
Speaker 2: At the next post-mortem or weekly review, run through any unfinished items and highlight improvements backed by metrics.
Speaker 1: If tasks stall, escalate or reassign them so they don't linger forever. Closing the loop shows you're serious about follow-through and prevents lingering action items from becoming new incidents. A quick thank-you also goes a long way in keeping momentum high.
