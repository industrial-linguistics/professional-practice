Speaker 1: The first message after a major incident should be short and clear. Think "Our database server went down at 1 pm, we restored service by 2 pm, here's what happened."
Speaker 2: Attach or link to the post-mortem document so anyone who needs the gritty details can read them later.
Speaker 1: Send a similar summary to leadership, but highlight the business impact, such as how many users were affected, and outline next steps.

Speaker 1: Sharing in different channels—email, Slack, or a status page—keeps everyone aligned and sets expectations for follow-ups.
