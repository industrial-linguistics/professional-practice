# Metrics to Monitor
*MTTR, recurrence & follow‑up progress*

---

## Why measure?
- Show whether improvements work
- Spot repeat issues early
- Prioritise resources based on data
- Keep leadership informed
- Meet audit obligations

---

## Key metrics
- Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
- Recurrence rate of similar incidents
- Action item completion ratio
- Age of open follow‑ups
- Number of updates sent to stakeholders

---

## Tools and dashboards
- ServiceNow and Jira reports
- Spreadsheet trackers for small teams
- Grafana or Kibana graphs for trends
- Export data to CSV for audits
- Share metrics during retrospectives

---

## Using the data
- Compare trends month to month
- Escalate if recurrence stays high
- Highlight wins when MTTR drops
- Review overdue actions in stand‑ups
- Adjust processes based on evidence

---

## Key takeaway
Metrics reveal whether fixes stick and guide where to focus next.
